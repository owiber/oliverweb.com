<p>Welcome to OliverWEB 2005, where all your dreams come true!  Even Sam's!  Just follow the yellow brick road!  Becoz, becoz, becoz, becoz, becoz!!  No one gets in to see the wizard, not no way, not no how! <br /><br /> ...*ahem*... so, if you're curious where all the old OliverWEB stuff on the sidebar went... it's gone. Yes yes, I've decided to drop all the old stuff and create an entirely new site including backend, layout, etc.  The <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/main">old OliverWEB</a> can still be found by clicking on the "legacy" link at the top right of this page. Enjoy!</p>

<p><img alt="liquidstage.jpg" src="http://www.oliverweb.com/images05/blog/liquidstage.jpg" width="400" height="234" /><br />
Van and I signed up for FAST lounge at Liquid (the group that helps setup in the morning), so we had to wake up at 7AM.  It was highly unpleasant, especially since we went to sleep at around 4AM... haha.  When Van and I got to UTC, no one was there, so we proceded to call Tim names because he told us to arrive promptly at 8AM.</p>

<p>Then, after lunch, I took a nice 4+ hour nap. Yummmmy.</p>

Tonight, at about 4AM, a police helicopter started circling our apartment with spotlights blazing.  Here's a shot of the cop parked outside our rooms, <a href="http://www.bamboovanpoo.com">Van</a> probably has some more shots, and <a href="http://www.xanga.com/your_shadow">Sam</a> has a little blog about the event as well.  Heh... we're in an awesome area. =)</p>

<p>On another note, I just downloaded <a href="http://www.picasa.com">Picasa</a>, the picture album program <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> bought and made free (yay!).  I like it lots better than iPhoto and it makes me happy. =D</p>

So Brook and I were up until 5AM or so just talking about all kinds of things like <a href="http://www.liquid-acc.com">Liquid</a>, relationships, etc. etc.  Then Chad popped in and we eventually drifted into politics... Mark later joined the fun and I ended up not sleeping until probably around 7AM. Three hours of sleep, baby! ZZzzzzz...</p>

<p>My mom and Olivia dropped by this morning to deliver <a href="http://www.roundrockdonuts.com/">Round Rock donuts</a>. Hotness.</p>

I'm in linguistics... I think I need more sleep (even though I got like seven hours of sleep last night). I'm feeling the stress of many aeons upon my shoulders! Hehe, I actually just wanted to use the word "aeons"... it looks cool. Aye, tonight I gotta do a lot of web stuff, grade a bunch of assignments then... hmmm... then I guess I can rest. Might try to hit bed a little sooner tonight.</p>

<p>Man, WarCraft3 DOTA games are hot though. Some highlights from last night:<ul><li>Van (with invisibility) and my wind walking crazy ranged guy sneaking up behind Sam and Paul and swiftly taking them out.</li><li>Sam yelling out "I'm leaving the demon edge by the acolyte."</li><li>My hearing Sam's previous comment and wind walking to the location and "stealing" the demon edge. =)</li></ul>Oh the hotness... I think we're addicted.  Oh yeah, enjoy the random rodent pic.</p>

I am lacking sleep.  I'm tired, but I need to do my homework that might have been due last class period even though the professor didn't tell us. Mark, Paul, and I took Chad to the emergency room last night at around 4AM because of his chest pains.  After being in the examination area for a while, a doctor came out and... blablablabla... so I went with the doctor guy and eventually he said to me "I... just don't know if he's going to make it."  I just started laughing... =)  I don't feel like typing anything else, so you'll have to live with this really messed up version of the "story."  Oh yeah, and Chad's ok... just minus $100.</p>

I hate iPhoto.  Slow monstrous beast that screws up any sort of organization I would like to have with my photos. Ugh.  iChat stinks too. Apple needs to improve those two a lot (I hear Mail too, but I don't use it, so I don't know).  I don't even know why I still have my PowerBook. ;)</p>

<p>As for the picture, I liked it... so here it is, Wagner and whatever the business school is called. Bums. ;P</p>

So at <a href="http://www.liquid-acc.com">Liquid</a> today, Van and I both brought our cameras.  Now there are quite a few camera-wielding people there with prosumer level equipment, it's the hotness.  Getting into photography is a lot cooler than I expected... I notice things around the world more than I normally would, and sometimes the shots you take surprise yourself.  Having it strapped to my back with the massive lense is pretty cool too, I feel like I have a weapon I can yank out and DESTROY with. BWAHAHAHAAAA... erhm... ok, I'm done.</p>

<p>Sorry to the people in the jump castle thing, I didn't really get any good pics except for this one of it falling over. =)</p>

<h3 id="a000024">Th. Anonymous</h3>

<p>Seems to be the common practice nowadays to bash/complain/scold/whatever some anonymous being which supposedly exists in our world past, present, or future.  So, I've decided to join the bandwagon this time! (Yay!)  I also came up with a new abbreviated title, "Th." short for "Thing" just so you can't pin-point who (or <i>what</i> even!) I'm talking about versus if I were to use Ms. or Mr.</p>

<p>So... here's goes nothing.</p>

<p>You sicken me with the stunts you try to pull.  You never leave me alone, always coming back for more.  Why won't you just GO AWAY?!  Curse you and your kind! Why must you always nag at my ear and leave me in pain for weeks to come? What did I ever do to YOU?!  You cause me sleepless nights. You backstab me.  You stab me over and over and over again. Mosquito, this I swear... I shall <a href="http://janim.net/flash-games/mosquito/mosquito-flash-game.html">destroy you</a>!!! (high score: 1535 after a few min of playing)</p>

<p>Oops... kinda messed up that anonymous part of it. ;)</p>

I'm noticing a trend... haha. =) </p>

<p>Van and I went to get some UV filters for his lenses tonight (where we saw that ATM sign above). Then we cruised on over to campus and took some pics in the dark (mine didn't turn out so hot =).  Went over to the Union and had some food with OMan and Alex.</p>

<p>After that, we went over to check up on Sam and his whole TASA Night thing.  There's something about Asian pop that really really bothers me.  The martial arts shows were pretty cool though, as were the Chinese yo-yo things. Hot stuff. Saw quite a few familiar faces there, but I think there's something about large crowds that make me uncomfortable...<br />

<p><img alt="bed.jpg" src="http://www.oliverweb.com/images05/blog/bed.jpg" width="400" height="269" /><br />
When I was a kid, I always had the thought that I'd be dating and/or even married by the time I graduated college (yes, yes, a bit young for marriage, but that's the idea I had in my head long ago =).  It just seemed like <i>the age</i> and so so far away. Now that I'm about to graduate in 1.5 semesters... man, I'm freaking out.  It's not really that I'm scared I won't find a girl (well, I am a little =), just that the "after college" phase of my life is such a mysterious void.  School's all I've ever known.  I've always been around people relatively my age...</p>

<p>Man, am I ready to "grow up?" You always ask kids what they want to be when they grow up and now I'm at the stage where I actually have to do it. Wow.  This past summer, I thought I was ready.  I really liked my internship and I felt like I'd be ready to leave school after one more year.  But... man, I just don't know if I'm ready...</p>

<h3 id="a000019">HUNGER</h3>

<p>Man, I'm hungry.  Lunch is 1.5 hours away though, *sigh*. Got my EE test back... 4th highest in the class, so I think I'm good. =)  I could have been the 2nd highest, but I accidently misread part of a question and only answered it half-way (even though the other half was SUPER EASY).  Oh well. Wheeeeee!  I think I'm looking good for an A in this class, here's shooting for a straight 4.0 this semester! *cough cough*</p>

<p>So far, we've spent 2+ weeks on logic circuits, it is the most hotness ever because I don't have to listen to my professor at all!  Queen is the hotness too.  Speaking of hotness, the weather is not so terribly hot or cold, but it's a bit cloudy.  Makes me not bring my camera to school because I don't want to get rained on. POO!  I want to test my new lense...</p>

<p><img alt="utc.jpg" src="http://www.oliverweb.com/images05/blog/utc.jpg" width="400" height="325" /><br />
I actually took this picture yesterday in Buddhism, but it works cause my linguistics class is in <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/maps/main/buildings/utc.html">UTC</a> too (and all the rooms look the same =). After this, I gotta go eat lunch, then I have lab hours for 2 hours, 30 minute break, <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/admin/utpd/defensive.html">defensive driving</a> from 5:30 - 8:30, then it's camping time!  I think.  Here's hoping I don't get lost on the way. =)</p>

<p>I found a <a href="http://www.chrispederick.com/work/firefox/webdeveloper/">cool extension</a> for <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox">Firefox</a> the other day.  It lets you change/edit style sheets dynamically, display borders around table/block elements and all kinds of other crazy stuff.  It's the HOTNESS.</p>

<p>Hmmm... I should make a "HOTNESS" stamp/button or something...</p>

NAND, AND, XOR, OR, NOT, and all the other happy little... umm... logic stuff. Wheeeee, it's great when the prof. spends over a week on a topic you already have down. =)  Alright, off to linguistics...</p>

<h3 id="a000005">The Hotness</h3>

<p>Weeeeellll, it's October and that means I'm supposed to make a new OliverWEB design.  As you can tell, I actually did it "on time" this year.  I decided to get rid of all the old stuff and so if you want to look at any of the pages/posts from the past, you'll have to use the legacy link at the top of this page to view the <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/main">old OliverWEB</a>.</p>

<p>I decided to give <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type</a> a try, so that's the backend at the moment.  I also pretty much completely used <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS</a> for the layout stuff, which is actually pretty cool.  I'm waiting for my camera to come in within a few days, but after that, I plan on posting pics and treating this somewhat like a photo-blog.  I'm also going to try to keep the page(s) "<a href="http://validator.w3.org/">XHTML 1.0 Transitional</a>" validated (whatever that means), but we'll see how that goes. =)</p>
