<p>Welcome to OliverWEB 2005, where all your dreams come true!  Even Sam's!  Just follow the yellow brick road!  Becoz, becoz, becoz, becoz, becoz!!  No one gets in to see the wizard, not no way, not no how! <br /><br /> ...*ahem*... so, if you're curious where all the old OliverWEB stuff on the sidebar went... it's gone. Yes yes, I've decided to drop all the old stuff and create an entirely new site including backend, layout, etc.  The <a href="http://www.oliverweb.com/main">old OliverWEB</a> can still be found by clicking on the "legacy" link at the top right of this page. Enjoy!</p>

<h3 id="a000043">RSS Headline Reader</h3>

<p>Well, I wrote a quick script to grab RSS feeds from various blogs/sites.  You can see the result on the left over there. =)  Apparently, I pounded away on the <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">/.</a> servers a bit too much as I'm banned at the moment (which explains the headlines underneath that).  Anyways, that ban should go away in a bit as I've changed my reader to update every 35 minutes instead of every 10 which they didn't like so much.</p>

<h3 id="a000038">Fishy</h3>

<p>lol, I don't know why but Philmore's Fishy song (I think Chad played it for me way back in high school... man... long time ago) just popped into my head.  Here's the beginning:</p>

<blockquote>Sometimes I wonder
If I'll ever find her
The one that God's chosen for me
And what if I find her,
But she doesn't like me,
I guess that disproves destiny
But I should know better,
The sea is much wetter
With plenty of fishes to see
(For you and me)
And I know my Father
Has scoped out the water
And picked out a fishy for me</blockquote>

<p>I never really got what the rest of the song said cause I couldn't make them out (and didn't listen to it enough to decipher it), but I just read the <a href="http://lyrics.rare-lyrics.com/P/Philmore/Fishy.html">rest of the lyrics</a>, and it's the hotness.  </p>

<p>The other day, Van sucked Mark and I into watching some <a href="http://www.spcnet.tv/reviews/review.php?rID=192">Good Luck!!</a> with him.  Man, dramas are so much more enjoyable watching them with Van because he gets so into them.  Watching them makes me feel kinda girly though... I don't think that's good...</p>

So Brook and I were up until 5AM or so just talking about all kinds of things like <a href="http://www.liquid-acc.com">Liquid</a>, relationships, etc. etc.  Then Chad popped in and we eventually drifted into politics... Mark later joined the fun and I ended up not sleeping until probably around 7AM. Three hours of sleep, baby! ZZzzzzz...</p>

<p>My mom and Olivia dropped by this morning to deliver <a href="http://www.roundrockdonuts.com/">Round Rock donuts</a>. Hotness.</p>

I'm in linguistics... I think I need more sleep (even though I got like seven hours of sleep last night). I'm feeling the stress of many aeons upon my shoulders! Hehe, I actually just wanted to use the word "aeons"... it looks cool. Aye, tonight I gotta do a lot of web stuff, grade a bunch of assignments then... hmmm... then I guess I can rest. Might try to hit bed a little sooner tonight.</p>

<p>Man, WarCraft3 DOTA games are hot though. Some highlights from last night:<ul><li>Van (with invisibility) and my wind walking crazy ranged guy sneaking up behind Sam and Paul and swiftly taking them out.</li><li>Sam yelling out "I'm leaving the demon edge by the acolyte."</li><li>My hearing Sam's previous comment and wind walking to the location and "stealing" the demon edge. =)</li></ul>Oh the hotness... I think we're addicted.  Oh yeah, enjoy the random rodent pic.</p>

So at <a href="http://www.liquid-acc.com">Liquid</a> today, Van and I both brought our cameras.  Now there are quite a few camera-wielding people there with prosumer level equipment, it's the hotness.  Getting into photography is a lot cooler than I expected... I notice things around the world more than I normally would, and sometimes the shots you take surprise yourself.  Having it strapped to my back with the massive lense is pretty cool too, I feel like I have a weapon I can yank out and DESTROY with. BWAHAHAHAAAA... erhm... ok, I'm done.</p>

<h3 id="a000024">Th. Anonymous</h3>

<p>Seems to be the common practice nowadays to bash/complain/scold/whatever some anonymous being which supposedly exists in our world past, present, or future.  So, I've decided to join the bandwagon this time! (Yay!)  I also came up with a new abbreviated title, "Th." short for "Thing" just so you can't pin-point who (or <i>what</i> even!) I'm talking about versus if I were to use Ms. or Mr.</p>

<p>So... here's goes nothing.</p>

<p>You sicken me with the stunts you try to pull.  You never leave me alone, always coming back for more.  Why won't you just GO AWAY?!  Curse you and your kind! Why must you always nag at my ear and leave me in pain for weeks to come? What did I ever do to YOU?!  You cause me sleepless nights. You backstab me.  You stab me over and over and over again. Mosquito, this I swear... I shall <a href="http://janim.net/flash-games/mosquito/mosquito-flash-game.html">destroy you</a>!!! (high score: 1535 after a few min of playing)</p>

<p>Oops... kinda messed up that anonymous part of it. ;)</p>

I'm noticing a trend... haha. =) </p>

<p>Van and I went to get some UV filters for his lenses tonight (where we saw that ATM sign above). Then we cruised on over to campus and took some pics in the dark (mine didn't turn out so hot =).  Went over to the Union and had some food with OMan and Alex.</p>

<p>After that, we went over to check up on Sam and his whole TASA Night thing.  There's something about Asian pop that really really bothers me.  The martial arts shows were pretty cool though, as were the Chinese yo-yo things. Hot stuff. Saw quite a few familiar faces there, but I think there's something about large crowds that make me uncomfortable...<br />

<p><img alt="bed.jpg" src="http://www.oliverweb.com/images05/blog/bed.jpg" width="400" height="269" /><br />
When I was a kid, I always had the thought that I'd be dating and/or even married by the time I graduated college (yes, yes, a bit young for marriage, but that's the idea I had in my head long ago =).  It just seemed like <i>the age</i> and so so far away. Now that I'm about to graduate in 1.5 semesters... man, I'm freaking out.  It's not really that I'm scared I won't find a girl (well, I am a little =), just that the "after college" phase of my life is such a mysterious void.  School's all I've ever known.  I've always been around people relatively my age...</p>

<p>Man, am I ready to "grow up?" You always ask kids what they want to be when they grow up and now I'm at the stage where I actually have to do it. Wow.  This past summer, I thought I was ready.  I really liked my internship and I felt like I'd be ready to leave school after one more year.  But... man, I just don't know if I'm ready...</p>

<h3 id="a000019">HUNGER</h3>

<p>Man, I'm hungry.  Lunch is 1.5 hours away though, *sigh*. Got my EE test back... 4th highest in the class, so I think I'm good. =)  I could have been the 2nd highest, but I accidently misread part of a question and only answered it half-way (even though the other half was SUPER EASY).  Oh well. Wheeeeee!  I think I'm looking good for an A in this class, here's shooting for a straight 4.0 this semester! *cough cough*</p>

<p>So far, we've spent 2+ weeks on logic circuits, it is the most hotness ever because I don't have to listen to my professor at all!  Queen is the hotness too.  Speaking of hotness, the weather is not so terribly hot or cold, but it's a bit cloudy.  Makes me not bring my camera to school because I don't want to get rained on. POO!  I want to test my new lense...</p>

<p><img alt="utc.jpg" src="http://www.oliverweb.com/images05/blog/utc.jpg" width="400" height="325" /><br />
I actually took this picture yesterday in Buddhism, but it works cause my linguistics class is in <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/maps/main/buildings/utc.html">UTC</a> too (and all the rooms look the same =). After this, I gotta go eat lunch, then I have lab hours for 2 hours, 30 minute break, <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/admin/utpd/defensive.html">defensive driving</a> from 5:30 - 8:30, then it's camping time!  I think.  Here's hoping I don't get lost on the way. =)</p>

<p>I found a <a href="http://www.chrispederick.com/work/firefox/webdeveloper/">cool extension</a> for <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox">Firefox</a> the other day.  It lets you change/edit style sheets dynamically, display borders around table/block elements and all kinds of other crazy stuff.  It's the HOTNESS.</p>

<p>Hmmm... I should make a "HOTNESS" stamp/button or something...</p>
