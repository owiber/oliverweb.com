smileys, and *evil cackle* </font><font color="#0000FF"
face="arial">(that scares me =)</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><strong>Funniest moment:</strong> my

color="#0000FF" face="arial">(I'm telling you... she's wild </font><font
color="#0080C0" face="arial">(yay! Like me!!!)</font><font
color="#0000FF" face="arial">=) </font><font face="arial">of
Mike's car, then almost died when I got out and a cloud of carbon
monoxide hit me... AND... my most embarassing one was on Spirit
Day last year... I was friggin' tired... I was talking to this
guy in tennis asking to use his green hair spray... I wasn't
really watching where I was going and I ran into one of those
poles that divide the double doors AND... maybe my funniest one
was... table dancing in colorado =) </font><font color="#0000FF"
face="arial">(yup, like I said... =) </font><font face="arial">scariest
moment... is a tie between the trunk incident and this guy from
houston following me around for the day </font><font
color="#0080C0" face="arial">(I wouldv'e punched him) </font><font
color="#000080" face="arial">(well, ignore what I said on her
school subject)</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><strong>Peeve:</strong> I hate it when you
get to be good friends with a guy... only to find out that all
along he just wanted to be MORE than friends, and he's not man
enough to stay buddies with you when he figures out there's no
hope. </font><font color="#0080C0" face="arial">(I know, right?) </font><font
color="#FF0080" face="arial">(guys just suck...remember?) </font><font
color="#0000FF" face="arial">(but... but.. eh... nevermind, I
won't get into that =)</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><strong>Favorite event/moment:</strong>
&quot;</font><font color="#000000" face="arial">Laying on a
hammock on the porch of my *perfect* water-front beach house on
the Virgin Islands (translation: huge as hiney, white, with TONS
of windows and skyroofs, with a nice white sand beach), in the
arms of the *perfect* man (translation: tall... I mean,
reasonably taller than me, built (yes yes, I mean 6 pack!),
gorgeous smile, sweet, sensitive, funny, and caring), who is ever
so sweetly feeding me grapes... course, that's NEVER happened...
haha, will it ever? </font><font color="#0000FF" face="arial">(no
=) </font><font color="#000000" face="arial">Is there such a
thing as a perfect guy? </font><font color="#000080" face="arial">(Yes,
of course! That would be me. Everyone knows I'm the hottest guy
ever... :-) </font><font color="#000000" face="arial">Guys... if
you think you fit this description... smack yourself to make sure
you're not dreaming. </font><font color="#0000FF" face="arial">(*smack*
J/K! J/K! J/K! =) (Doh! added another smiley... now I lost
count... I think it's 70 something now...) </font><font
color="#000000" face="arial">Then maybe you can call me up.
heh...&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><strong>Self description:</strong> If there
was ever a *sane* person with multiple personalities, it'd be me.
Depending on the day, I can be totally bubbly (yes, a ditzy
asian!), mellow, crazy, majorly emotional (meaning, I'm crying
over dumb stuff like breaking my pencil), or a BIG... biscuit
(&quot;Biscuit&quot; you might wonder... well, it's one of my
alternate words. Figure out its meaning for yourself. I'll give
you a BIG hint... it starts with a B! *gasp*). Normally though, I
try my best to be a happy little child, and I promise if you try
to talk to me I won't bite your head off. Hehe...</font></p>
