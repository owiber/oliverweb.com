me the &quot;fuss factory&quot;, </font><font color="#0000FF"
face="arial">(hehe =) </font><font face="arial">sooooo... haha!
I'm really annoying sometimes and I'm really short. </font><font
color="#0000FF" face="arial">=) </font><font face="arial">I don't
have much self-confidence, but I've got a pretty good sense of
humor </font><font color="#0000FF" face="arial">(eh...) </font><font
face="arial">... sometimes. Hehe. I get depressed a lot... but
right now I'm in a HAPPY mood! Lucky for Oliver. :)~
Anyway........ um...... SMILE! :)~ </font><font color="#0080C0"
face="arial">(Oh, ok, that day I was kind of not in a good mood,
so I wrote mostly negative things. Right now, I'm in a HAPPY
mood, so I'll write good things. Hopefully....hahahaha. Anyway, I
like to sing, although I'm not good at it, but I like to draw and
I'm good at that. =) </font><font color="#8000FF" face="arial">(Yes!!!
I always used to tell you how good you drew and you denied it!
She's very good, people.) </font><font color="#0080C0"
face="arial">Ask Oliver! </font><font color="#0000FF"
face="arial">(why me? yeah... it runs in the family... at least
dad's side =) </font><font color="#0080C0" face="arial">Although...
he might say I'm a bad drawer but I am not! I draw pretty good!

shoulder-length black hair and brown eyes </font><font
color="#0000FF" face="arial">(Noo... she's just chinese with
blonde hair and blue eyes...*sigh*) </font><font color="#0080C0"
face="arial">(duh) for those people who haven't seen me. I don't
look like Oliver at all, Oriana looks almost exactly like me when
I was her age. Ummm... lala... My nickname 3'11&quot; down there
was when I was in 4th grade. I was actually 3'11&quot; in 4th
grade! Don't laugh at me! Argh! Anyway, Now, I'm about
4'11&quot;, so I grew a foot in FOUR years... wow... haha! At
least I grew. Anyway, I can tell Oliver is getting impatient to
get back on his beloved computer so, I better go now. :)
BYE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) </font><font color="#8000FF" face="arial">(Thank
you!!! That last one was sooo negative! I like this description
much better. By the way... some chinese people ARE blonde! Like
Oliver.) </font><font color="#0000FF" face="arial">(As you can
