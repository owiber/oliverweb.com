compliments no one&quot; and &quot;When you realize you want to
spend the rest of your life with someone, you want the rest of
your life to start as soon as possible.&quot; and &quot;Life is

<p><font color="#000000" face="arial"><strong>Funniest moment: </strong>I
was on the phone around 2 AM and I started making up a story
about La La La Land and talking in third person...and I dont'
want to explain b/c you just had to be there. But ya know, being
that late and insane, I might as well have been drunk. AND... it
was also around 2 AM and Kimberly Chuy was here and we were
reading some old notes and there was one that said, &quot;I like
oranges, do you like oranges, I want some oranges now, oranges
are good, they are very orange...&quot; and for some reason we
cracked up and woke my mom up and..anyway, you had to be there
again. </font><font color="#8080FF" face="arial">(Yea, you get
kinda high when you're up that late... hehe, it's funny talking
to people when they're all disoriented like that.)</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="arial"><strong>Peeve: </strong>People
that get a big head or really stuck up and think they're all
that. HELLO! We're all people! We're equal...and notice all the
people who THINK they're all that are the ones that people
think...or totally NOT!? UGH.... </font><font color="#000080"
face="arial">(</font><font color="#000080" size="1" face="arial">coughcoughJOCKScoughcoughCHEERLEADERScoughcoughUPPERCLASSMENcoughcough
</font><font color="#000080" face="arial">...oh, wait! I'm now an
upperclassmen! yeah!!!) </font><font color="#8080FF" face="arial">(I'm
sorry I have to be the one to break it to you... but... you
failed Brian... you're going to be a Soph again next year...
UNDERCLASSMAN =) (btw, your statement was gramatically
incorrect... &quot;upperclassmEn&quot; is plural...
&quot;upperclassmAn&quot; is singular. Hahaha, I feel so smart
now! =))</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="arial"><strong>Favorite
moment/event:</strong> Westlake competition last year when it was
raining cats and dogs...on our friggin expensive instruments! But
hey, ask any marcher and they'll say marching in rain is the
BEST! </font><font color="#8000FF" face="arial">(Well it can be
fun! But standing at attention in sleet just gets annoying) </font><font
color="#000000" face="arial">AND....football game vs Westwood
this year when I got marcher of the week for marching only 20
minutes that week due to a stomach inflation AND </font><font
color="#0000FF" face="arial">(*SIGH*!)</font><font
color="#000000" face="arial">... my 12 hour phone
conversation...it was a ruff nite b/c I cried and cried and
cried...(hehe) and I got 4 hours of sleep but I stayed
&quot;connected&quot; to SOS and it was just nice to wake up and
have him just right there...made everything okay.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="arial"><strong>Self description:</strong>
I probably look like Doris, everyone says I do. Or my mom. So...I
look like my mom and sister. </font><font color="#0000FF"
face="arial">(they don't really look that much alike... just you
non-asian people think that, hehe =) </font><font color="#8080FF"
face="arial">(Everyone thinks we're twins... do I really look
THAT bad? (hehe, j/k, Nance is perdier than me =)) </font><font
color="#0000FF" face="arial">(like I said... you non-asian
people! =) </font><font color="#000000" face="arial">I'm not as
quiet as Olga </font><font color="#0000FF" face="arial">(stop
calling me that! =) </font><font color="#8080FF" face="arial">(Okay
OVARY) </font><font color="#0000FF" face="arial">(and that too!) </font><font

color="#8080FF" face="arial">(yup yup, I'm loud =) </font><font
color="#000000" face="arial">I'm not as stupid as Lucky but not
as smart as Gracey... </font><font color="#8080FF" face="arial">(heh,
me a stupid airhead) </font><font color="#0000FF" face="arial">(oh
yes, she's stupid, but she's #4, so that makes me/us...) </font><font
