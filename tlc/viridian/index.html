          <b>The Viridians</b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Viridians are a 
          group of environmentalists who are trying to promote awareness of our 
          treatment towards the earth through an art and design movement. The 
          founder of the Viridians, Bruce Sterling, created all of the group's 
          principles and first widely presented his ideas on October 14, 1998 
          when he gave his &quot;Viridian Design Speech&quot; at the Yerba Buena Center 
          for the Arts in San Francisco. He also allows little dispute over the 
          principles, stating that anyone who wants to change his principles 
          should start their own movement.</font></p>
          <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">The Contests</font></b></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although the group concedes that they 
          will, one day, be obsolete and/or die off, to keep them active and 
          alive presently, there are various
          <a href="http://www.viridiandesign.org/Contests.htm">contests</a> that 
          members participate in. &quot;Big Mike,&quot; the Viridians' mascot [above 
          right] was a result the
          <a href="http://www.viridiandesign.org/contests/contest1.html">first 
          contest</a> at <a href="http://www.viridiandesign.org/">
          ViridianDesign.org</a>. It is through these contests that new 
          environmental awareness designs are created. The Viridians hope that 
          through their designs, people will become aware of the pollution that 
          we create and how we harm the earth. Perhaps, they will have a large 
          enough number of followers or a powerful political party (capable of 
          making important decisions that can make a difference) to eventually 
          produce beneficial effects upon earth and the environment.</font></p>
          <h1><font face="Arial">Principles</font></h1>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Viridians have certain design 
          principles that they try to convey when creating designs for contests 
          and/or just for the movement. They range from ideas regarding 
          lifestyle, morality, politics and more. Following, are summarized 
          versions of their
          <a href="http://www.viridiandesign.org/notes/1-25/Note%2000003.txt">
          principles</a>.</font></p>
          <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Futuristic Principles</font></b></p>
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>&quot;Eat What you Kill&quot; </b>- If you 
            stop doing something in order to help the environment by rendering 
            something obsolete, don't just ignore that object, but rather, fully 
            comprehend it. Show respect to the designers, so that you can also 
            comprehend your own accomplishments.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>&quot;Avoid the Timeless, Embrace 
            Decay&quot;</b> - Entropy should be shown more attention because nothing 
            physical is eternal. The Viridians believe that decay should be 
            studied and harnessed.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>&quot;Planned Evanescence&quot; </b>&nbsp;- 
            Once a product is obsolete, all of its physical traces and even 
            itself should vanish completely.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>&quot;The Future is History -- Be When 
            You Are&quot;</b> - Worry about fixing things <i>now</i>, not what could 
            have been done or what should be done later. Solve your existing, 
            present problems and do not romanticize about the past and/or 
            future.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>&quot;History Accumulates&quot;</b> - 
            History only grows, so we need better ways of storing it.</font></li>
          </ul>
          <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Moral Principles</font></b></p>
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>&quot;Look at the Underside First&quot;</b> 
            - In order to be a wise designer and/or critic, you must look at the 
            bad parts of products before the good parts.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>&quot;Design for Evil&quot;</b> - Always 
            take into considering a product in the wrong hands, design a product 
            so it cannot be used in a very harmful/evil way.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>&quot;Superstition Isn't Inspiration&quot;
            </b>- Don't allow your imagination to overcome the facts of the real 
            world.</font></li>
          </ul>
          <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Political Principles</font></b></p>
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>&quot;Viridian Inactivism&quot;</b> - Do 
            not become involved with activism. A better way of benefiting the 
            environment is to find something that worsens the problem and stop 
            doing it (don't go out for a joy ride in your car, but rather enjoy 
            the stars in your backyard, etc.).</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>&quot;Do Less with Less&quot;</b> - We 
            should try to find new ways of doing things that do not harm the 
            environment, but also, do not go about life in a frenetic way; 
            relax.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>&quot;There's No One so Green As the 
            Dead&quot;</b> - Don't argue about who is &quot;Greener&quot; - dead people are the 
            &quot;Greenest&quot; because living people contribute to the CO2 load by just 
            existing. Just think about your life and how you use the earth's 
            resources.</font></li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>&quot;The Biological Isn't Logical&quot;</b> 
            - Not everything has to be non-chaotic and created with careful 
            precision. Nature grew sporadically without a set pattern, so when 
            you design, learn from nature and &quot;chaos.&quot;</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>&quot;Augment Reality: Aestheticize 
            All Sensors&quot;</b> - <b>&nbsp;</b>Sensors should be the next aesthetic 
            frontier because they must interact with human sensorium.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>&quot;Make the Invisible Visible&quot;</b> 
            - We can now do things that artists never could before because we 
            can see things better (better scientific instruments). We should 
            exploit this ability artistically.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>&quot;Less Mass, More Data&quot;</b> - 
            Physical resources should be replaced with information.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>&quot;Tangible Cyberspace&quot;</b> - 
            Create objects that are created in the digital form.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>&quot;Seek the Biomorphic and the 
            Transorganic&quot;</b> - We must thrive in an altered nature (due to 
            technology and our pollution).</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>&quot;Datamine Nature&quot;</b> - We should 
            look for aesthetic novelty in things we could not see before 
            (microorganisms, etc.).</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>&quot;Grow Complexity&quot;</b> - Create

            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>&quot;Walk Through the Walls of 
            Knowledge Guilds&quot;</b> - Boundaries that separate art, science, 
            medicine, etc. are not concretely set. You can do what it takes 
            (within reason) to learn more about subjects.</font></li>

          <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Contest Entries - Expression</font></b></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The entries themselves express both the 
          ideas of the group as a whole as well as each individual's unique 
          perspective. Although large differences in the group's principles are 
          not &quot;allowed&quot; (Sterling believes they should just create their own 
          movement), different interpretations and ideas on principles are 
          welcome. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The design to the left 
          avant-technogarde design principles. Taking many aspects of nature and 
          incorporating them into a teapot/teakettle design, the artist conveys 
          the message that there are alternate ways of doing things that do not 
          pollute the earth. The pot also seems to be alive, unlike a plastic, 
          metal, or ceramic pot used by many people today. This shows that we 
          don't have to destroy the environment to use it but rather &quot;coexist&quot; 
          in a symbiotic relationship with it. All of the artist's ideas 
          coincide with the Viridian's ideas and principles.</font></p>
          <p>
          <img border="1" src="tepot.jpg" align="right" width="200" height="235"></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The pot to the right was submitted to 
          the same contest as the &quot;organic teapot&quot; (which won the contest). 
          Obviously the design elements vary drastically. The winner used 3D 
          computer generated graphics while the one to the right used very 
          simple computer drawing tools (or just scanned it in?). The &quot;chicken 
          pot&quot; takes design ideas from a chicken, depicting it on the pot. A 
          majority of the pot is also green, perhaps symbolizing nature and the 
          chicken symbolizing life. Although ideas are not conveyed as well as 
          the winner (perhaps why it is not the winner? =) it is obvious that 
          different ideas and focus points were aimed at by the two artists, 
          although both used the principle &quot;The Biological Isn't Logical.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Technology's Effect on Social 
          Interaction</font></b></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
          <img border="1" src="heat.jpg" align="left" width="149" height="150">The 
          Viridian's view on technology is both good and bad. Although they view 
          many technologies as environmentally hazardous, they use technology in 
          order to convey their message. Even in their emails they append the 
          text &quot;O=c=O&quot; to remind themselves (and others) that even their small 
          message is using up power and contributing to the carbon dioxide load 
          in the air/environment. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The graphic to the left depicts the 
          words &quot;HEAT KILLS&quot; and has an image of a person in agony with bright 
          sun rays upon him. In the background, is a large city with tall 
          buildings. The artist is conveying the message that technology kills 
          (pollution made by technology, like cars, produces global warming) 
          people. What better way to end social interaction than to kill people? 
          No people - no social interaction. Thus, the Viridians say that 
          technology can destroy society by destroying us by destroying our environment.
          <img border="1" src="greeny.jpg" align="right" width="150" height="150"></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On the other hand, the Viridians also 
          believe technology can help us. The &quot;Greeny Megawatt&quot; to the right is 
          a parody of Reddy Kilowatt (a symbol of electric/power utility 
          companies which produce a lot of pollution to provide power). 
          Depicted, is not Reddy Kilowatt being destroyed (which would convey a 
          message that technology should be destroyed), but rather he is instead 
          transformed into a &quot;green&quot; environmentally sound Greeny Megawatt. 
          Thus, the Viridians believe we can use technology (just in a different 
          way than we are now) with a more environmentally aware perspective in order 
          to improve our quality of life while preserving our earth.</font></p>
          <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Interaction with Basic Tenets</font></b></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Do the artists who participate in the 
          Viridian contests live up to or redefine the basic tenets of the 
          Viridians? I believe that a majority of the principles are broad 
          enough so that they are very hard to redefine. Therefore, the only 
          thing entries <i>can do</i> is live up the tenets/principles. Since 
          every artist can have their own view upon the principle and how they 
          want to go about conveying their idea, I think that every entry lives 
          up the tenets/principles that the artist aimed for. Similarly to 
          &quot;beauty is in the eye of the beholder,&quot; certain works of art could 
          have a more profound effect on certain people. Looking again at the 
          two teapots, I was more effected by the &quot;organic teapot&quot; than the 
          &quot;chicken teapot&quot; - <i>but</i> someone else may have a different 
          opinion, so I think that every entry lives up to the basic tenets in
          <i>someone's </i>opinion, making it worthwhile.</font></p>
          <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Evolution of Contests</font></b></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The contests themselves did gradually 
          change over time. In the beginning, many of the contests were more for 
          the benefit of the group rather than to convey their beliefs (although 
          they did convey their beliefs <i>while</i> benefiting the group). For 
          example, many of the first contests were to make &quot;fancier&quot; the group 
          and it's website. There was the
          <a href="http://www.viridiandesign.org/contests/contest1.html">Big 
          Mike</a> contest, and the
          <a href="http://www.viridiandesign.org/contests/contest4.html">banner</a> 
          contest. Although they did eventually convey the Viridians' ideas (by 
          attracting more people or to make them look &quot;cool&quot; - Big Mike is kind 
          of cool looking =), they did not do so as directly. Later contests' 
          sole purpose (or main purpose) was to convey Viridian ideas and 
          principles. Contests that fit into this category are the
          <a href="http://www.viridiandesign.org/notes/126-150/00147_greenhouse_symbol.html">
          Greenhouse Disaster Symbol</a>,
          <a href="http://www.viridiandesign.org/contests/contest02000_1.html">
          Dead Mike</a>, and

          Reddy Kilowatt Makeover</a> contests.</font></p>
          <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Evolution of Entries</font></b></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Deciding if the entries themselves 
          changed over time is a hard decision. Many different people 
          contributed to the contests and many submitted drastically different 
          designs. Since multiple people worked on different designs, there is 
          no real point of comparison between on contest and another. One 
          contest may, overall have better looking art (although that'd be just 
          in my opinion) than another, but that may not constitute an 
          &quot;evolution&quot;... it may just mean different people submitted ideas.</font></p>

          are patterns in what people submit. There are generally serious 
          submissions and comic ones, almost every contest has at least one of 
          both. All of the entries of course share the same idea, in general, 
          and use most of the same principles, but everyone does it slightly 
          differently. The design to the left is rather simple and not quite 
          comical at all, yet it conveys global warming. The image on the right 
          is meant to show the same message, however it does it in a bit more 
          artistic/cartoony/comic way (hey, he looks funny). So, entries within 
          contests obviously vary greatly because artists often have drastically 
          different ways of conveying themselves.</font></p>

          submissions as time progressed because the group gained followers, but 
          other than that, I don't think a very conclusive answer can be made as

          shown earlier, through Greeny Megawatt, the Viridians don't desire to 
          totally annihilate technology, but rather use it to fix technology's 
          faults. Or rather, the faults of people who use technology. </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the ad to the left, the Viridian 
          ideas and design movement (portrayed/symbolized by Big Mike) is said 
          to be thought of as &quot;f@#%ing cool&quot; by the scientific community. Since 
          scientists are very much related to technology, Viridians believe it 
          can be made to do good towards the environment. They would like 
          pro-environment technologies to thought of as &quot;cool&quot; and good to have 
          rather than a pollution creating counter-product.</font><p>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">Unlike ideas such as the Unabomber's 
          Manifesto which wanted almost no technology/industry whatsoever, 
          Viridians merely want technologies to be created more environmentally 
          friendly and for that to be portrayed as a &quot;cool thing.&quot; Also, since 
          they also believe in the principle, &quot;Planned Evanescence,&quot; the older 
          product (pollution creating one) should be destroyed as well as all 
          physical traces (the pollution it creates) - thus improving the 
          environment and our quality of life.</font><p><b>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">Left Alone</font></b><p>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">
          <img border="1" src="filth.jpg" align="right" width="180" height="252">If 
          technology is not redesigned to be more environmentally sound, then it 
          will end up destroying the earth and probably humans along with it. 
          This idea is very much evident in many of the Viridians' design 
          contests.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The &quot;Got Milk?&quot; spoof 
          to the right demonstrates this idea very bluntly with the text 
          &quot;redesign the world/or end it.&quot; </font>
          <p>
          <img border="1" src="weather.jpg" align="left" width="120" height="119"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 
          design to the left also has a similar message, although not as plainly 
          said. The sun is shown &quot;attacking&quot; a person due to violent weather 
          produced by pollution. Again, the two both portray similar Viridian 
          beliefs yet do it very differently showing that there is not <i>one 
          specific</i> way the Viridians must go about conveying their message.</font><p>
          <b><font face="Arial" size="2">How does art stop pollution?</font></b><p>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">Many people wonder how the Viridians 
          actually help stop environmental pollution. They concede the fact that 
          they pollute (&quot;O=c=O&quot; example) yet don't really do anything to stop 
          pollution (other than small little personal habit changes, etc.).</font><p>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">The Viridians respond to this through 
          their designs. For example:</font><p>
          <img border="1" src="warming.jpg" align="left" width="200" height="280"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 
          picture shows Big Mike (the Viridians group) and states that art <i>
          can</i> stop global warming.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The 
          group believes that through their art works and designs they can 
          persuade people to their cause. They know that alone they can't do 
          much, but if they promoted environmentally safe products to be &quot;cool&quot; 
          (like scientists think Big Mike is cool example) then they may be able 
          to attract a larger portion of the population and make them think 
          about the environment. What they would really like is to persuade a 
          person or group that has significant power, such as a political group 
          so that they can have national or even global effects that can help 
          the earth.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">So, the art does not 
          directly stop pollution like electric-powered cars do, but they do (at 
          least the Viridians hope so) promote awareness which can lead to 
          stopping pollution in the future. Hey, better later than never. Or 
          wait, ti's better now than never.... oh well, you get the point. =)</font><h1>
          <font face="Arial">My Entry</font></h1>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In order to get a better understanding 
          of the Viridian contests and their entries, I will &quot;participate&quot; by 
          creating my own entry to a contest.</font><p align="center">
          <img border="0" src="banner.jpg" width="468" height="60"><p align="left">
          <font face="Arial" size="2">The above image is a submission to the
          <a href="http://www.viridiandesign.org/contests/contest4.html">banner 
          contest</a>. Here is an excerpt from the rules:</font><blockquote>
            <font size="1" face="Verdana">First, we 
          need constructive, forward-looking banners for clean websites. We're 
          not particular about their chosen source of energy, except that we 
          despise CO2, and we're not real big on nuclear fission. We prefer 
          sustainable, non-brittle forms of power, that can't evaporate cities 
          full of civilians in one big flash. So, the net requires new banners 
          for inventive, novel websites that choose to use wind, solar, hydro, 
          tides, biomass, alcohol fuel-cells, ocean thermal-energy conversion, 
          geothermal, and, who knows, maybe even cold fusion and quantum 
          sonoluminescence.</font></p>
          <p><font size="1" face="Verdana">If you're in a darker mood, we'd love to see you create a sinister, 
          hideous, reprehensible banner for websites that still insist on 
          burning the smashed juice and crust of long-dead organisms. After all, 
          the vast majority of us are still using this vile, nasty form of 
          power, and we are therefore required to commit acts we know to be 
          evil, whether we like it or not. If you're just one little user of, 
          for instance, AOL or Geocities, your personal websites will be spewing 
          dirty power for quite a while. However, if we had the proper kind of 
          nasty banners, we could load them up as a personal protest at this 
          unbearable status-quo.</font></blockquote>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Pretty much, the idea is 
          to create a banner that informs users of computers (and surfers of the 
          web) that even using their internet browser and/or emailing uses up 
          power and adds to the global warming effect (similar to the message 
          conveyed by the &quot;O=c=O&quot; text). The energy required by computers is 
          generated by burning fossils and/or nuclear power (both of which the 
          Viridians aren't too keen of).</font><p align="left">
          <font face="Arial" size="2">My entry basically says the above except 
          in a comic way. It only pertaining to Texas viewers however (thus not 
          really useful for a national or international website) but makes the 
          viewer think about the consequences of their actions nonetheless. To 
          the right of the banner is a very uncomfortable person (with heat 
          resonating from his head and sweat from the side =).</font><p align="left">
          <font face="Arial" size="2">Although my banner doesn't specifically 
          mention fossils, CO2, or nuclear power plants, it does basically the 
          same thing in a more subtle way. I chose a comic approach because I 
          like comedy and I think people are more likely to treat your ideas 
          with thought if you do it a good way... I think comedy is a good way. 
          (<i>Office Space</i>'s creator must've thought the same thing? or 
          maybe he just wanted to be funny...).</font></td>
