<b>Week 1 - "2001: A Space Odyssey"</b>
<p>I believe that Kubrick is trying to say that with the advent of tools, humans (or proto-humans) became more aggressive and violent. Before tools were discovered, the two rival proto-humans merely "put on a show" when they confronted each other. It was a game of who could bluff more and/or <i>show</i> more physical strength. After one "clan" began using tools (the bones from a dead animal), they no longer bluffed but actually became violent; killing the rival proto-human from the other clan.
<p>Not only does some tools/technology lead us to violence, but often the way we discover such tools is somewhat violent or chaotic. In the movie, the proto-human, out of curiosity, discovers that the bones can be used as a "bashing tool." The mere action of hitting bones against each other to create movement or noise (or whatever stimulated the proto-human) evolved into using the bone as a weapon. The fact that the bones are from a deceased animal also hints at the violent (often leads to death) nature of tools. In modern times (or more modern times), many things are discovered by chance (chaos) as well - such as penicillin. The scientist never planned on discovering a substance which could help in curing bacterial illnesses. 
<p>Kubrick also shows that tools affect our development by allowing us to do more things or do things a different "better" way. In the movie, the clan that discovered the use of bones as weapons most certainly would become the dominant clan because of the tool they now use - being able to overcome the others who did not know how to use weapons. The black monolith also symbolizes a coming of technology, which invokes change within the proto-humans which "find" it. After the monolith, the proto-human's pace of life speeds up, driving the beings to discover new things and produce new tools rather than focusing only on survival from day to day. The movie conveys this through the somewhat slow and boring scenes of sunrise and sunset where you see the proto-humans performing simple actions. After the monolith and the first tool is discovered (the bone), the movie rapidly jumps thousands of years to the space age, where supposedly, humans have become (almost?) perfect as well as their creations, technology, and tools as symbolized by the waltz music and ballet-like portrayal of space stations, satellites, etc. 
<p>When the humans are depicted as almost mechanical, Kubrick hints that something essentially human may have been lost, because of technology and the humans' reliance and use of it.
