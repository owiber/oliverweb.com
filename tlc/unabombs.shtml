<b>How do ideas presented in the manifesto compare to those made by Kubrick in 2001: A Space Odyssey?</b>
<blockquote>Kaczynski says that the modern society (and our developed technology) we live in is different from the one we were supposed to evolve into, thus creating turmoil and unhealthy lives. In contrast, Kubrick presents the idea that technology is merely an expression of human nature, even though it can sometimes cause harm. Both come to a consensus on the idea that technology can cause harm and negative effects. However, Kaczynski views these effects as unnatural, unnecessary and unhealthy - believing we should "start over" and try to evolve the way we were "meant to," into a natural and healthy society, unpolluted by technology while Kubrick merely presents technology as almost a part of humans themselves. He neither says that technology is bad nor good, merely that it is, and that humans use it in many different ways (good/bad).</blockquote>

<b>Is the Industrial Revolution the only event which drastically separated us from our environment?</b>
<blockquote>Kaczynski believes that "only with the Industrial Revolution did the effect of human society on nature become really devastating" but we have decided that the Revolution was <i>not</i> the only event where humans have had large impacts upon nature. Even Kaczynski states that "pre-industrial societies can do significant damage to nature" although believing that the Industrial Revolution was far worse than that. Many other events have had large impacts on the way humans have interacted with nature. During the middle ages, many many acts of deforestation occurred in order to build homes, castles, war-machines, etc. The Black Plaque killed a vast amount of people primarily because of how they structured their cities and treated waste. Communities were very dirty and unhealthy, resulting in the rapid spreading of the plague. Both events were far before the Industrial Revolution, yet both were very devastating to nature and/or humans and resulted in even further separation of humans and nature. Thus, we conclude that the Industrial Revolution was not the only event which drastically separated humans from the environment.</blockquote>

<b>How does Kaczynski's ideas of unintended consequences compare to Tenner's revenge effects?</b>
<blockquote>The ideas of unintended consequences and revenge effects are similar, but not the same. Both are negative and are a result of technology (or humans' use of technology). Tenner's revenge effects are somewhat ironic in a literary sense, creating a negative effect almost directly opposing the effect that was intended. For example, the patriot missiles used during Desert Storm were meant to protect, but rather caused harm because of debris created. Kaczynski's unintended consequences, although negative, don't always have an "opposite effect." He says that cars "restrict greatly man's freedom" because people are basically forced to use them now, thus creating a negative effect. Cars were not intended at first to have people "FORCED to use it," but rather to be a time-saving luxury to people who could afford it. They were not meant to offer more freedom, thus the negative affect of less freedom is not a revenge effect. I do not believe that the manifesto's aim and the conclusion derived from Tenner is the same. The manifesto aims to drastically change society and eliminate a majority of technology and industry. Tenner merely points out revenge effects created by technology, warning of the bad effects caused by it. He gives a cautious warning to people who use and/or adopt new technology, but I do not believe he seeks to drastically eliminate and change our use of technology and society.</blockquote>

<b>How can Kaczynski and the Viridians start in the same place and end up with drastically different ideas?</b>
<blockquote>Although their ideas are very similar at the start, it is the way the two tried to achieve their goals and convey their ideas that drastically made them different. While Kaczynski resorted to using technology in a bad way and conveying his ideas through scare-tactics, the Viridians merely believed in the use technology to create works of art that have messages behind them. The Viridians try to gain the help of a powerful body that CAN make the changes they desire, while Kaczynski tried to force his ideas upon people by harming them. The Viridians also do not want to totally abandon society and start anew like Kaczynski, but rather to come up with ways to start to save the environment and cease the harming of it.</blockquote>
