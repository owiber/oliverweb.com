<h2>Chad's Jobs</h2>
<b>Phone Interviewer @ Gallup Organization</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Incessant calling of people on the phone.
<li>Read words plastered to a computer screen, and, should the respondent be unsure of an answer, probe them for the best answer they can think of.
<li>Type answers into computer screen using numbers.
<li>Fill out pay sheet.
</ul>
We think Chad's job, on the most part, is a Mechanical Age-type job. If there were a robot that would not get hung-up on, Chad would not have a job. There is little thought other than sound-recognition and the creation of a "personalized intro."
<br><br>
<b><i>Math Teacher</i></b>
<ul>
<li>Distribute information to teenagers in a personalized manner.  There is no SPECIFIC outline for how this job is to be conducted, and a good teacher modifies her/his style according to the students.
</ul>
This job is mostly automated, whereas the teacher incorporates more of their specific personality into the job at hand.  Instead of being a mechanized worker, a teacher needs to be a dynamic thinker.


<h2>Steve's Jobs</h2>
<b>Pizza Facilitator @ Austin's Pizza</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Driving around delivering pizza to people who order them.
<li>Occasional discovery of short-cut(s) for faster delivery.
<li>Receiving money/payment for delivered goods.
</ul>
We concluded that Steve's job was a mechanical job which required little creative thought and was primarily repetition of set actions.
<br><br>
<b><i>President of major music label</i></b><br>
<ul>
<li>Keep track of and, if possible, create new trends (or make sure people in company are doing that)
<li>Manage company (make sure everyone is doing what they should be)
</ul>
This job is automated because you must be able to take in information and make many different decisions based upon that information. You must also be able to predict and think ahead about the outcome and result of your decision(s).

<h2>Scott's Jobs</h2>
<b>Food Services @ Alamo Drafthouse</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Serving food to customers.
<li>Yeah, essentially just bringing food to customers and refilling drinks, etc.
</ul>
Definately a mechanical job since there is no creative or "upper-level" thinking required. Basically just following "orders" and performing low-intellect actions.
<br><br>
<b><i>Technical Correspondent for major news channel</i></b><br>
<ul>
<li>Keep up with current technology trends
<li>Predict what could be the "next hot thing"
<li>Have the ability to explain technology item
</ul>
An automated job since you must seek and interpret information on your own. Rather that just perform the same tasks over and over again, he would be making his own decisions and have the chance to be creative.

<h2>Bob's Jobs</h2>
<b>Consumer Service Rep @ gas station</b>
<ul>
<li>Ring up items people pay for
<li>Ensure that items are where they should be
<li>Restock items if they sell out
<li>Press the red-button to restart the car wash
</ul>
Again, a mechanical job for all the same reasons the other mechanical jobs were classified as mechanical. Little thought required and no information seeking and interpreting.
<br><br>
<b><i>Lawyer</i></b>
<ul>
<li>Keep up with recent laws as well as remember old ones
<li>The ability to be resourceful
<li>Interpret and understand laws
<li>Ability to formulate arguements and debate
</ul>
An automation-age type job since thought and decision-making is required.

<h2>Oliver's Jobs</h2>
<b>Web-developer @ Motorola</b>
<ul>
<li>Use technology to create visually-appealing websites for groups/sectors at Motorola
<li>Transform dull Powerpoint presentations into Flash presentations that were more "exciting"
<li>Programming small scripts to perform tasks on websites
</ul>
This is an automated job since the ability to create algorithms, solve problems, and be creative were required to fulfill the job.
<br><br>
<b><i>Project Manager for game company</i></b>
<ul>
<li>Manage group members
<li>Help create algorithms for problems throughout project-design
<li>Brainstorming
<li>Make crucial decisions about aspects of game
</ul>
Another automated job because complex-thinking is involved, not just repetition of the same thing over and over. New problems and decisions need to be solved everyday.
<br><br>
<h2>Age Transition</h2>
Will we ever reach an entirely Automated Age? I believe that there will never be a time where society will be all automated or mechanical, there will always be some job(s) that will be mostly automated and/or mechanical. Most jobs today have at least some characteristics of both. For example, even though we considered a teacher to be an Automated Age job, he/she must perform mechical-type tasks such as grading papers/tests. Even Mechanical Age type jobs have some automated characteristics, like Steve's discoveries of short cuts to make his delivering faster and more cost-efficient (save gas).<p>
There are even some aspects of our world that are moving towards mechanical rather than automated. For example, many large corporations would rather have a majority of workers be mechanical rather than automated. The automated tasks are left up to the managers and high-up bosses, who make decisions and have the mechanical tasks fulfilled by their employees. Constrastly, other companies do strive for more automated-oriented jobs, such as game companies and many technology related companies, which require creativity and intelligence to succeed.<p>I also believe that we cannot pin-point one period in history as the place where Mechanical Age ended and Automated Age began, the transition from one to another was probably prolonged and since many jobs incorporate characteristics of both, it's very difficult to determine an exact moment in history.
