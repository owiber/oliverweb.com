<p><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">1. The Austin Chronicle bills the display at the Goodwill 
Computer store as a museum. Consider you own experiences visiting museums, both 
as child and as an adult. (If you haven't been to a museum in awhile, I strongly 
suggest visiting the </span>

<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
  Arial">Museum</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">, located 
here on the University's campus--admission is free and the comparison may be 
most enlightening). Why did or do you specifically, and people in general, visit 
museums? What activities define your conception of a museum going experience? 
What should a museum look like and offer? Based on these definitions you've 
generated, is the Goodwill</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
 Arial"> </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Museum</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial"> actually a &quot;museum&quot;? </span></b></p>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">I visited museums as a child 
just for entertainment value with my family. My parents enjoyed bringing my 
siblings and myself there because we had fun while learning a bit more about the 
world we lived in. Museum-going, to me at that age, was merely a family 
entertainment-venture and nothing more. </span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Now, although I still visit 
museums for entertainment and often with family (although no longer limited to), 
I am much more interested in the facts and information the museums have on their 
specific genre. Rather than merely looking at the “neat looking fish” when I was 
a child, I now read what the museum has about that fish. </span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">I believe that people in 
generally visit museums for two reasons (usually both combined); for 
fun/amusement and to learn. Often when you become fascinated with something 
(which museums can encourage), you will enjoy learning about it. That’s what 
museums do. </span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Museums, I believe, should 
not be strictly restricted to what they <i>should</i> look like, but rather that 
they offer a wealth of information and convey it in an interesting manner. A 
high-tech museum may have holograms of certain animals while another may have 
statues or even stuffed deceased animals. The way the exhibits look should not 
really matter, as long as information can be adequately learned from them. The 
Goodwill Museum, I believe, is actually a museum. Its exhibits are old computers 
and people may enjoy reading about and seeing decade old (or older) computers 
such as Crays, IBMs, etc. </span></blockquote>
<p><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">2. Whether nor not you've defined it as a museum, this 
Goodwill location is also a retail outlet. Would you shop at the </span>

<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
  Arial">Museum</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">? Would 
you consider buying old or used technology? Be specific in explaining why or why 
not. Assuming you or your family have purchased computer technology before, how 
would it compare to your previous computer shopping experiences? What did those 
shopping venues offer that the Goodwill store did not, and vice versa? </span>
</b></p>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">I’ve never been to the 
Goodwill Computer Museum to shop, so I couldn’t say for sure if I’d buy 
anything. I probably wouldn’t spend a large amount of money (more than $20) on 
old computer parts and it would probably depend on what I find. If I found 
something that reminded me of my childhood, or something that I thought was 
“cool” then I might consider buying that item, just as long as the price was not 
overly-high from my point of view. I would be willing to spend some small amount 
of cash in order to have some piece of old technology if it made me happy.
</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">I believe that buying 
something from the </span><span style="font-size:
  12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Goodwill</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> 
Museum would differ in many ways from previous computer shopping experiences. 
When I buy a new computer, I buy it for performance because I plan on actually 
using it for development, gaming, education, etc. If I bought something at the 
Goodwill Museum, I would be buying the item because I thought it would be “cool 
to have.” I wouldn’t be buying it to use it particularly like I would a new 
computer, but rather more like a collector.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The places that I buy new 
computer parts at would obviously have the “state-of-the-art” components and 
would probably be more expensive than parts at the Goodwill store. Those 
shopping venues offered products which would be useful rather than things that 
would be collected. At the Goodwill store, more of the items there would 
probably be bought by hobbyists and collectors who enjoy owning old computer 
components and would not necessarily plan on using the parts.</span></blockquote>
<p><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">3. Many museums or displays within museums are target 
specifically for either children or adults (again, you may find it profitable to 
visit the </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Texas</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

 Arial"> </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Museum</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

about it, who is the </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">

Arial"> targeted toward?&nbsp; Does the adult versus child division have any impact 
on the actual preservation of old technology (consider both the museum and the 
Dead Media Project)? </span></b></p>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Based on the article, I 
think that the </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
  font-family:Arial">Goodwill</span><span style="font-size:
 12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> </span>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;

<span style="font-size:12.0pt;
  font-family:Arial">Museum</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> 
would be targeted towards adults who at least understood a little bit about the 
technology that was presented. Children may not find it so attractive because 
there are no moving parts, the machines do rather look dull and would have no 
memories of, say, when the “Apple I first debuted.” The people who would 
probably enjoy it the most would be adults who worked in the field and/or 
remember when some of the computers first were developed and sold.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">I don’t believe that the 
adult/child division has any impact on the actual preservation of old 
technology. I think that the primary goal of museums is to preserve the 
technology, then to convey information about that piece of history to an 
audience. It is then that the museum would decide who to target (adult or child) 
which would probably be dependant on the item being preserved. </span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The Goodwill Museum was 
directed more towards adults because children would probably find the exhibits 
boring and would not enjoy it. The Dead Media Project doesn’t really seem like 
it’s trying to target an audience at all, but rather just to preserve old 
technology. Although the way the old technology is recorded would be used by 
adults primarily, I do not think that they tried to purposefully target adults 
rather than children.</span></blockquote>
<p><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">4. Alex Bilstein is not a museum professional or historian by 
trade, yet he has become intimately involved in the preservation of technology. 
How did this happen? What role does the concept of nostalgia play in his 
activities, both at the museum and on his AtariAge web site ? </span></b></p>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Alex Bilstein became 
involved in the preservation of technology because it interested him, he 
enjoyed/enjoys it, and he thought it was important to preserve it. The concept 
of nostalgia plays a large role in his activities because it is probably the 
primary force that drives him to preserve old technology. It’s also probably 
what attracts most of his website’s visitors/readers. People who have a sense of 
nostalgia with Atari would be attracted to his website which prolongs and 
preserves the Atari’s technology.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Sometimes people just don’t 
like throwing things away to be destroyed. The Austin Chronicle quotes Bilstein 
as saying “customers wanted to find a home for their old machines.&quot; That, 
perhaps, is another factor in preserving old technology. Bilstein and others 
didn’t want to destroy their old artifacts so they preserved them by showcasing 
them.</span></blockquote>
<p><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">5. Compare Alex Bilstein to those people involved in the Dead 
Media Project. Do they have similar goals, methodologies and drives? </span></b>
</p>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Alex Bilstein and the Dead 
Media Project have the same goals in the sense that they both want to preserve 
history/technology. Both believe that what they’re doing is important and both 
have an interest in what they preserve. Since Alex Bilstein is just an 
individual and the Dead Media Project (DMP) is more of an organization, the DMP 
obviously seems more structured with an actual written manifesto and rules. 
Bilstein’s project seemed more of a hobbyist’s task rather than a larger-scale 
movement, like the DMP seems like.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">I believe a large drive of 
Bilstein’s is nostalgia. He enjoyed the Atari and was interested by old 
computers. The DMP doesn’t necessarily have that same amount of nostalgia 
driving it, but rather is driven by another force. Perhaps its goals are related 
to the Viridian Design movement (since Bruce Sterling was a major player in 
both)?</span></blockquote>
<p><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">6. Outline the Long Now Foundation's recipe for preservation. 
Be specific in describing what they deem necessary. Does the </span>

<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

Store, as described in the Austin Chronicle, run along these lines? What about 
the AtariAge gaming community or those involved in video game emulation? </span>
</b></p>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The Long Now Foundation 
believes that merely having a digital copy of something is inadequate. They 
quote statistics such as magnetic media only lasting “5 to 10 years” and CD-ROMs 
“if used only once, last only 5 to 15 years.” They think that exercise is the 
best way to preserve something. One of their proposals was to create artificial 
intelligence that would continuously use, exercise, and copy the media to extend 
its life. In order for something to be preserved, it must be constantly used and 
translated/migrated to new platforms while leaving a chain recording the 
translation/migration so that it would be possible to back-track and begin 
again.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">I don’t think the Goodwill 
Computer Museum runs along those lines, primarily, because the items are not put 
to use. A major difference also is that the Goodwill Museum records history by 
preserving the actual item, rather than digital forms of it. Therefore, you 
cannot translate and/or migrate to new platforms. The exhibits in the museum lay 
dormant and are not exercised at all. There is no one continuously using the 
computers and some of the computers (such as the Cray) cannot be operated 
anyways because of the lack of software.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The AtariAge gaming 
community and video game emulation more closely runs along the lines of the Long 
Now Foundation because they are continuously using Atari software and 
translating/updating/migrating it to new platforms (emulators). They are 
preserving the technology by continuing to use it, the best way according to the 
Foundation.</span></blockquote>
<p><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">7. The Goodwill Computer Store presented artifacts of 
computing on long shelves and in chronological order of development. Machines 
and hardware were basically mute--small cards described them in short detail and 
none of the machines were actually plugged in or turned on. The computer museum 
and computers themselves are built very differently, and of vastly different 
materials, from the Long Now's library/cave and clock. Now that the Goodwill 
Computer Museum is no longer open for public touring, what do you think will 
happen to the ideas it represents (that computer technology is worth preserving) 
one, ten, fifty, one hundred and five hundred years from now? </span></b></p>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The ideas that the Goodwill 
Computer Museum represents, I think, will continue to live on. In fact, I 
believe that its ideas will become stronger as more time pasts on because the 
items will be harder and harder to find. Similar to when comic books were first 
released, there were no museum exhibits for them or large-scale collectors, but 
as time went by, their value and worth grew and grew and now some of the old 
ones are worth lots of money and are showcased by collectors and/or museums.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The ideas will continue to 
live on, perhaps not through the Goodwill Museum but by other, similar projects. 
The Austin Chronicle states that the Smithsonian has a computer history 
collection and that there are a few (although not many) others across the 
country. Since the Smithsonian is such a large prominent museum, I don’t think 
that the ideas of preserving computer technology will die anytime soon. There 
are also the works and collections of private collectors who will make the idea 
live on.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">In one or ten years there 
may not be much of a difference in respect to computer history, but I think that 
after 20 to 25 years, there will be more and more organizations and project that 
will attempt to preserve old computer technology. Computer history will probably 
be similar to car/automobile history. People will continue to use the new 
cars/computers, some will use the old, but we will preserve the old ones to 
record information about objects/technology that greatly impacted human society.</span></blockquote>
<p><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">8. What about the computer you're now completing this project 
on? Speculate for the same time frames as those listed in question 7. Consider 
not just the physical machine itself, but people's understanding and ability to 
understand the social sphere in which computer users operate. </span></b></p>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Physically, my specific 
computer will probably not last more than 100 years, if that. Unless if I become 
very famous and my computer having a large impact on that, I doubt my computer 
will be of any historical importance. I will probably end up scrapping most of 
the parts and after a few years it wouldn’t even really be the same machine 
anymore.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Again, I think that the 
computer would probably be similar to the car. I know how to drive a modern-day 
car, but I may not know how to drive some of the early prototypes of cars and/or 
how they operate. I, myself, have not studied too much on cars, so I wouldn’t 
know how they initially impacted society and/or how they were received and 
viewed by it. Same thing could be applied to computers. A comical example could 
be brought from Star Trek (I forget which one... the one with the whales =), 
when the people from the future tried to use the old computers, they were not 
sure how use the mouse/keyboard at first but tried to talk to the computer.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Although some people will 
not be able to understand the way computers impacted people in the past in a 100 
or more years, there will always be a few people who will study and learn about 
that – just like how there are people who know a lot about cars and how they 
first were introduced into society.</span></blockquote>
<p><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">9. Is there anything particular about computer and digital 
technology that makes its preservation different from other forms of technology? 
Does the fact that the Museum portion of the Goodwill Computer Store is no 
longer open to the public relate to possible differences in preservation? </span>
</b></p>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Computer and digital 
technology is different from other forms of technology in regards to 
preservation because a lot of the technology cannot be viewed directly and can 
be easily lost (which is what the Long Now Foundation said). Often, when a small 
portion of digital technology is corrupted, the whole thing is corrupted and not 
viewable. For other types of technology, if something is broken, you may still 
be able to examine parts of it.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Preserving the actual 
hardware (in non-working condition) does not differ too much from other 
technologies (such as old telephones, typewriters, etc.). Therefore, I do not 
believe that the fact that the Museum is no longer open to the public relates to 
the difference of preservation. The Museum basically showcased the physical 
hardware components of computers, not the software (the computers were not 
running with software viewable).</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">I think that the Museum was 
basically shut-down due to insufficient man-power/demand/interest. And perhaps 
some rude people really were stealing from it (tying into not enough man-power 
to watch over the collection). I don’t think it had a lot to do with the 
differences in preservation.</span></blockquote>
<p><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">10. Will you mourn the passing or replacement of the computer 
you're currently working upon? What about other technology you use day to day 
(car, bike, telephone, stereo, wrist watch, TV, microwave, etc...)? Would you 
consider keeping any items even if they're obsolete or you purchase a 
replacement? Factor in both the chance of these items breaking down/wearing out 
and continuing to operate even if they're old. </span></b></p>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">I would not mourn the 
passing of my present computer because the reason for the “passing” would 
probably be because I bought/made a new one, which would make me happy. =) I 
view my computer as merely a tool and toy. If I get a better one that does all 
the same things and more/better, then I will be happy.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">I would, however, probably 
keep my present computer if I got a better one because I may still be able to 
use it for other misc. tasks. Or to experiment upon – doing things that I would 
not risk doing on my main/new machine. I may also keep it as a back-up incase my 
main machine breaks down and I have to resort to a slower machine for 
emergencies.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">I don’t think I would mourn 
the passing of any technology I use day to day as long as I would have a 
replacement. If I had to move from a car to a bike as my main mode of 
transportation, then I would probably mourn, but only because I lost the 
advantages a car gave me, not really because of the loss of the technology 
itself.</span></blockquote>
<p><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">11. What role does image and our consumer culture play in 
people adopting and discarding technology? How about in consciously choosing to 
use old technology?&nbsp; It may be useful to observe shoppers at places like Best 
Buy or </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Circuit</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
 Arial"> </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">City</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial"> when answering this question. </span></b></p>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">No doubt the image of a 
product will impact which technologies become adopted faster or not. Especially 
for products that will be used for entertainment, the image of it will greatly 
impact how well it is received or not.&nbsp; When Microsoft released the XBox, they 
tried desperately to hype it up while downplaying their own brand name because 
some people had anti-Microsoft views. Nintendo on the other hand, hyped up its 
GameCube and made no attempt to downplay its name at all because the Nintendo 
brand-name is associated with fun games that many teens/young adults grew up 
with in their childhood.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The image of something does 
also affect consciously choosing to use old technology. The original Nintendo 
Entertainment System is viewed as “cool” because many of my age group grew up 
with it (nostalgia? =) and associate it with fun-times. I have a friend who 
recently bought a Super NES which is quite old because it’s still viewed as 
“cool” although not the newest thing out there.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Image can make or break the 
adaptation of new technology. In the USA, Sega (excuse my abundant use of 
console examples =) was unable to create good image thus result in the Dreamcast 
basically flopping, but in Japan the Dreamcast is one of the most popular 
consoles despite the technological lead the PlayStation2 has on it - thus, 
showing that the technology alone does not lead to the adaptation of it.</span></blockquote>
<p><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">12. Is the impact of consumerism and image different from 
digital and computer technologies as compared to other technologies? Give 
specific examples and contemplate your own opinion. Again, it may be useful to 
observe shoppers at places like Best Buy or </span>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
  Arial">City</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">. </span>
</b></p>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">I don’t think that the 
impact of consumerism and image is different from digital and computer 
technologies as compared to other technologies. For example, the new Dell 
commercials try to depict “getting a Dell” as “cool” and “hip” just like other 
companies try to do with their (non computer) products (such as Nike – they’re 
the “cool shoes to have”).</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Digital and computer 
companies use the same marketing and image promoters other types of companies 
do. Apple Computers always is trying to go for style (Sony does in a lot of its 
products as well) as a selling point by selling multiple different color-types 
of its computers. </span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">If a type of shirt or shoe 
is the “hip thing to do” many people may go out and buy that. The same may not 
be true of computers (since the cost of them restricts consumers to just go out 
and buy it), however, if a brand of computer is deemed “cool” then when the time 
comes to buy a computer, that brand may be the first choice among buyers.</span></blockquote>
<p><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">13. Do you own or frequently use any particularly old piece 
of technology (computer or otherwise)? Why? Why haven't you replaced it or 
decided to learn to use a new technology? For this question it will be necessary 
for you to define what you mean by &quot;old&quot;. </span></b></p>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">My definition of “old” would 
be roughly 10 to 20 years because that’s what I feel is old when it comes to 
technology. I have an old television which still works and that I use in my 
room. Although it is bigger than and perhaps not as crisp as newer televisions, 
it serves the purpose I want it to and I am content with using it. I am also not 
willing to spend a couple hundred dollars to buy another better one at the 
moment because I can get by happily with my old one.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Most of my other pieces of 
technology <i>are</i> new and have replaced older versions. I replaced my 
corded-phone with a cordless one because it was relatively inexpensive and 
provided a lot more freedom. I also replaced my old computers with new ones in 
order to do more things, such as play newer games, do things faster and more 
efficiently, and more at the same time.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">I think that old technology 
is not replaced if the cost of replacing it does not outweigh the advantages of 
the newer technology. The advantages could be judged differently from person to 
person, so it’s solely a relative opinion.</span></blockquote>
