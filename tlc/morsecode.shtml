<ol>
<li>Online Morse code simulators do not particularly share the same 
application as they once did, though saying that they are completely obsolete 
would be ill-founded. It appears as if the only value these Morse code 
simulators hold is to provide entertainment for the bored, and also to inflict 
the largest possible magnitude of pain upon the aforementioned bored person's 
closest of friends who dared to provide he/she with an email address. Aside from 
the appeal to boredom, these simulators also capture part of a time that we 
typically no longer experience. These are symbols of our past, providing us with 
a window into another time, and allowing us to feign the entity of a sinking 
ship, much to the confusion of the other stall-confined persons in the bathroom.<br>
&nbsp;<li>Someone would be driven to emulate morse code to preserve the past out of 
interest. Like people who spend much time preserving old technology (ie. Atari), 
the people who created the morse code emulator probably have an interest and/or 
deep fascination with the old form of communication. So in order to record and 
preserve their interest, they created online forms of it. The web is an 
excellent way to let others know about their interest and perhaps attract people 
with similar interests because of its very large available audience, cost 
efficiency, and ease of use. Computers and complicated languages such as java 
were just means of communicating through the web. In order to use the web, you 
must use a computer and the programmer must use some language in order to 
display information. Java (and in some instances Perl, PHP, or perhaps others) 
just happened to be the author's chosen language. Porting over an old technology 
onto current technology as an emulation helps to preserve that technology for 
historical purposes. <br>
<br>
Creating an emulation of old technology is different from merely collecting the 
technology because it requires a deeper understanding of that technology (not 
saying that collectors cannot have a deeper understanding - just that it is not 
necessary). There are advantages of both; with emulating morse code, you can 
show the inputs and outputs of the system, but you don't have the actual morse 
code machine to look at. With collecting, you may have the reverse (if you can't 
operate the machine). <br>
&nbsp;<li>
Aside from the fact that the game play in these online video games are not 
very much congruent to the original game, the experience generally associated 
with these games just does not shine through in these online replicas. When 
people used to go to an arcade, or another venue housing a gaming apparatus, it 
was a social event; competition swarmed the air as a plague of locusts amongst a 
fresh corn-field. The experience is NOT essentially the same. These games are 
pretty much just incredibly boring, whereas that gaming atmosphere just is not 
there. I remember going to arcades and watching in awe as da game masta's did 
their thang. It was a Codec moment. Now, during these java games, the actual 
concept of the original games are there, but the aspects that made those games 
the bicketybangs just are not. <br>
&nbsp;<li>
No, there are not any essential differences between real and web based radio 
broadcasts. They both essentially do the same things (broadcast songs, news, 
etc.) and most for the same reasons (to make money). There are quite a few 
differences between the two, but I wouldn't classify them as essential. Web 
based broadcasts often have lower sound qualities than real radio, but allow the 
station broadcasting them to reach a wider audience. The sound quality often can 
make web based broadcasts less desirable, but again, I wouldn't call that an 
essential difference. And, of course, the technology used to play the two 
methods are different (radios/computers). <br>
&nbsp;<li>
Web radio does not specifically entail a step toward web TV, which is all 
together an entirely separate entity, and does, in fact, already exist on 
certain websites. And also, the majority of web radio is not particularly 
interactive. Web radio is very similar to normal radio with the minute 
differences between commercial length and quality. Because of it's 
accessibility, web radio is not somewhat of an evolutionary dead-end. As 
internet connection become more and more permanent, people who listen to web 
radio will be able to find more stations specialized to their tastes in music, 
as well as the decreasing risk of &quot;losing reception.&quot;. If interactive television 
does indeed arrive one day, I do not think that web radio will die off, but it 
will probably not be as popular as interactive TV. Web radio is not paving the 
way for interactive TV, but rather just evolving separately. The content on web 
radio is much more specialized dependent upon the channel, and this will draw a 
specified listening pool.<br>
