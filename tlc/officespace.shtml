<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">1. What 
is the role of music in <i>Office Space</i>?</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">At many 
points in <i>Office Space</i>, music was used to convey the characters’ emotions 
and state of minds. Also, for comic effect, the music over-dramatized the scene 
while also showing characters’ emotions or intent. For example, heavy rap was 
used during scenes where the main characters were doing “bad things.” The heavy 
rap also conveyed a feeling of anger and hatred towards work, giving the viewer 
a sense that the employees had a desire to rebel.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">2. Are 
characters’ jobs and response to them essentially similar?</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I would 
say that each main character’s jobs are essentially similar because everyone 
disliked their job (except for the managers of each business). Every character 
responded similarly by rebelling in their own way. The employees at the office 
(Peter and his friends) rebelled by stealing money from the company, Joanna 
rebelled by flipping her boss off and quitting, and Milton rebelled by burning 
down the building at the end of the movie.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">3. Is
<i>Office Space</i> more successful than the Unabomber’s Manifesto in making 
people think about their place in society?</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I would 
say <i>Office Space</i> has a larger chance of making people think about their 
place in society because of the way it was delivered. While <i>Office Space</i>’s 
message is delivered via comedy, the Manifesto was delivered through threats and 
scare tactics. Many people didn’t really listen to the Unabomber’s message but 
rather were afraid of what he did, how he should be punished, etc. <i>Office 
Space</i>, on the other hand, although many people would merely treat it as a 
comedy (a very good one at that) it does have a better chance of making people 
think of their place in society because people can relate to it better (although 
it probably exaggerated many things for comedic effect).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">4. Why 
did Peter take a new job at the end of the film and seem to have a new lease on 
life?</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">After 
their old company building burned down, the employees went to a different 
company (at least Peter’s friends at the office did), but Peter went to work at 
a different non-computerized work place. He did seem to have a new lease on life 
because he seemed happier and put up with work, possibly even enjoyed it a 
little. If Peter had gone to work for another computerized he would probably 
have hated it like his previous job.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Revenge 
effects for a non-computerized work place could be things like advanced 
construction tools which are supposed to help in construction, but end up 
complicating matters because the user must learn and know how to operate the 
tool(s).</span></p>
