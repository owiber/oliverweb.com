<h2>Digital Cameras</h2>
Digital cameras have many advantages over regular cameras. They are cheaper in the long run (don't have to develop/buy film) and allow you to easily delete pictures you don't want (rather than having to develop the whole roll of film). Being able to easily transfer the pictures onto a computer allows for easy touch-up and computer-effects. Although regular cameras still have a few advantages (focusing/blur effects and professional developing), many people are now using digital cameras.

So, have digital cameras influenced the way we act in society, or do we use them more as an extention of ourselves in order to convey ideas? Through our discussions, we have come to the conclusion that we use digital cameras as a tool to make our memories more permanent and vivid and/or to convey ideas in an artistic fashion. Digital cameras make taking pictures easier and more convenient in many ways, thus helping the photographer, but other than that makes no significant difference in the way we go about our lives.

Yes, digital cameras do not have a tremendous impact, if one at all, on the lives of the user.  Thinking specifically of the social ladder, monkey's aren't too smart.  Do they use digital cameras?  Aside from some random chewing upon them, no, not really.....  This is evidence that we are far superior to them.  And because we are so smart, we are not, therefor, used by far insuperior inanimate objects.  According to Socrates, humans have souls that contain absolute truth and intelligence.  Objects, however, do not have these souls, and thus do not contain any absolute intelligence, like us humans.  We are superior to cameras, Q.E.D.
<br><br>
We then, however, decided that just because something was inferior does not mean it does not have the ability to affect our lives. Animals such as snakes or other poisonous/deadly things could be classified at inferior and/or soul-less, yet they have the ability to affect us (by killing us). Cars, which have no intelligence whatsoever, have changed our society and the way we go about doing things, allowing us to do many things we could not do before. Without a car, many people are left helpless, not being able to get to work, get food, etc.
<br><br>
Alas, we run into seemingly endless contradictions to ourselves, we come to another conclusion and decided that digital cameras are not objects without intelligence and souls that influence our lives. Without a digital camera, people are not left helpless and can often acheive it's purpose another route. Whether by drawing, painting, video-taping, or going back to the regular film camera, people are generally not left helpless without a digital camera.
