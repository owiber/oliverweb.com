<h2>Modern Times, Modern Problems</h2>
<h3>1. Revenge Effect Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>When the machine that was supposed to help the factory by feeding it's workers while they worked (thus eliminating the lunch break) instead slowed down the pace one worked and ate, that was a revenge effect. Rather than producing a more productive worker, the machine didn't feed the worker well at all by malfunctioning and was "not practicle" (to quote the factory manager/owner). Specifically, this is could fit into the recomplicating effect category because it complicated matters by requiring a technician or someone to make sure the machine worked and it distracted the worker requiring him to concentrate harder in order to get his job done.
<li>Another recomplicating effect example is the "time card technology". Rather than working on your own farm and/or business, you must go to the factory and clock in and out. This complicates matters reqiuring workers to remember to clock in and out after entering/leaving the factory and before/after breaks. Designed to make things easier, it actually makes things harder for more people than it helps.
<li>A recongesting effect is that of the mass-production of the factory. When the factory gains the ability to produce more goods (when the factory head instructs the factory to speed up), attempting to increase productivity and theoretically easing the ability to create one unit of that item (since it takes less time to make), it actually makes work for the workers harder by making them work at a more rapid pace.
<li>The factory itself also creates many more problems. Rather than one person or a small group of people who are specialists working on hand-crafting the produces item, "mindless automatons" are used to do simple tasks while the factory automates many other tasks. Rather than make production easier, the factory could break down in many areas (since it is so complex), thus rendering the whole plant and everyone who works there useless since the "automatons" would not have the ability to fix anything. There are also more jobs that must be held, the manager, the person who "pulls the levers" (the one the manager talked to "directly" through the screen), and eventually a technician that would be able to fix the factory when something went wrong. This is an example of a regenerating effect, because it produced more problems for the company than it solved.
</ul>
<h3>2. Chaplin a Luddite?</h3>
I do not believe that Chaplin is a Luddite. Although driven mad by the technology in the factory and happy to live a simple like without technology, he is not <i>ANTI</i>-technology (at least, I do not think the film tried to convey that he was). He willingly worked at the factory and did not protest against the technology itself. All he wanted was to be happy and eat well. He was perfectly content in jail, where he was fed and sheltered. Although I do not think he was a Luddite, I don't think he should be automatically classified as a Globalist or Multi-Nationalist or like Giddens with "manufactured risk" and "so-called precautionary principle" ideas. Again, all he wanted to do was to be happy and well fed, he didn't worry about "global ecological risk, nuclear proliferation, or the meltdown of the world economy." Chaplin's character did not seem to hold any extreme opinions whatsoever in the film.
<h3>3. The Individual!</h3>
The individual would no doubtedly be affected by the changes/progression of the ideas in the articles. Although ONE individual may not be of any significance, since many individuals would be affected by change, then any bad affects on "the individual" would obviously stand contrary to the ideas of the International Chamber of Commerce and Giddens articles. Because a large action or movement towards "greater good" might help more people than it hurts, does not mean it should be done. The lives and the many individuals the action would effect are of importance and cannot be ignored for the "greater good" if it harms those people.  McCormick asserted that "multinational companies are a powerful force for good in the world," and they may be, but if ideas they have harm a group of individuals, then they should think twice before acting upon them. Although the individuals are obsticles of the movements, the ideas of the articles should not entirely be devalued. Many of the ideas introduced would be beneficial to a lot of people, such as "human rights, labour standards and environmental protection", thus should not be ignored. Rather, "work-arounds" and/or more ideas based upon the articles' ideas should be thought of and/or done in order to further minimalize the negative effects upon "the individual."<br><br>
