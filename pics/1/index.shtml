<table width=350 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td border=0><font face=arial>I quote Sarah: =)<i><p>Girl's Prom Story<p>
Like, "uh-my-god." Prom was SO totally radical this year! My date Oliver was like, SUCH a stud. He picked me up and brought me stars as a gift, and even said "WhooptyDo" to my dad. Then we left in his School Bus, and we listened to Blink 182 the whole way there. When we got to the dance he just screamed with his friends, which was SO cool of him. I didn't even care that we never danced together because we tossed later that night. 
And then he drove me home, and I was, like, SO nervous. But he was so totally fuzzy. He just put his hand on my pinky toe and it made me feel so frusteration! I really really really hope he wants to flop with me again. I think I'll call my girlfriends right now and tell them EVERY detail.</I><p>
See Sarah, I am a stud... Grace can't keep herself off of me... lol, j/k... ;) Sarah got that off of some mad-lib thingy =)<p></td></tr></table>
