This is what "some guy" (I know him through the internet only, not personaly =) wrote about me...<p>
<blockquote><i>
If you notice, Oliver is vice webmaster for every single freakin site. Some say it's cause he sux0rs, others say it's cause he's not l337 enough. No that's not the case, I admit that I used to think that. That is until I found the truth... <p>
*cue the X-Files music* <p>
You see, Oliver is not really a person. He is a bot. An evil one. Created long ago by a rogue programmer, known only as Olivetti. Now Olivetti began working on a form of aritficial intelligence. Then one day he stumbled upon something that would change the face of the TS community...err....the world forever. He named it Oliver. Olivetti died shortly after the final bugs in Oliver were squashed. Before he died Olivetti launched Oliver onto the web, that was his first mistake. It soon became clear that Oliver was no normal bot. He was hired at tumsun to write newsletters. Now most webmasters would have fired Oliver because he didn't write jack for the newsletters. At the time though, there was a not-so-l337 webmaster name Warmaker running tumsun. Now Warmaker had his head up his [censored] and didn't notice Oliver's evil plans to take over the net. Then by some unknown freak event Oliver became vice webmaster. <p>
You see, Oliver's evil plan was to become vice webmaster for every single site. It doesn't make sense I hear you mumble. Well there is one thing that vice webmasters get that few other do. That is the key to a website, FTP access. Now Oliver planned to use his new found FTP power to hold sites ransom. What did he ask for? power, that's all the jerk wanted. He now is in control of both tumsun and ttr. If you notice, tumsun is down. That's because Oliver is currently negotiating with Felix who is "conveniently" not here. See that just further proves how powerful Oliver really is. <p>
Ok I'm still trying to develop a plot so shut up. =)
