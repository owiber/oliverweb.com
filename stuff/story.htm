<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>It was a damp rainy day.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Everything was raining, even my cat.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Something smells of urine…….<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You walked into the door, and into my life.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Pretty sure urine smell followed….<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>These pants weren’t always soiled.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>i</span> reminisce of a
calm, cathartic life where men did not live in fear for their lives.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Yes, once upon a time, there was a timely time
where men and women lived peacefully together, a time where birds chirped, and
a time where urine went in the toilette, not in my pants.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>Until you…. and your gun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Thirteen
months ago, the heroin of this story, Woman Luvalot enters the scene.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One smile and the chicken I was eating decided
now would be the perfect time to choke the living crap out of me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Should have been a sign, foreshadowing what is
meant to be.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She walked up to me, making
the assumption that I know where her textbooks are.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Meanwhile brain fights with heart over what
comes first, reason or romance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><span
class=GramE>‘Twas a gruesome battle.</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Brain comprehends certain absolute truths, while heart understands only
nothing at all.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So they both have their
ups and downs, you know because getting flattened like a pug’s face is
understandably the greatest experience in one’s adolescent life.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then again there’s the brain with its
knowledge… but I say screw the brain (eat Oreos).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On this particular battlefield earth (great
movie and lifelong companion) heart took out mp5 navy and shot three rounds, <span
class=GramE>that’s</span> 90 bullets into Mr. Teammate, the brain.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While Krang babbled about how he didn’t want
to die, Shredder just said “Fire in the hole!!!” and proceeded to stuff a
flashbang up his frontal lobe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Now that
that has been made entirely clear, I can get back to the point of this story.<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>Woman was filled with gratitude when some
inhumane punishment from Hell actually led me to the correct book case.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So, I felt now was a good time to make my
move, before brain awoke from his beating.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If only God had been awake during this part of my life, His mercy would
not have allowed me to buy her books and invite her to “go over to my place and
play some video games.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We arrive
at my house after a short walk, and as she sits on the sofa, I death-march over
to my Playstation 2 console.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Dead or Alive
2 was the name of the game, and I have always perceived myself as a big fat
thorny land gnome. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Apparently she did
too, but brain was still unconscious and had not yet noted under “Things to
remember!!!!!!!!!! <span class=GramE>If you don’t you will die!!!” section.</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Wishing certain information had been bestowed
upon me prior to previous invitation, Ms. Luvnothing decides that she has known
all along that she knows video games are for know-nothing nerds.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So instead i remove her sandals and wash her
feet with scented oils.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
class=GramE>i</span> thoroughly enjoyed performing this task, but the scent of
those oils will never depart from these hands i fear.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She left that night after a cup of freshly
brewed my-blood, and i would not see her again for two days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>After i
awaken, two days later, i call the number she so graciously tattooed to my arm
with the end of her branding iron.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“Woman”
i said, and then proceeded to invite her, with an insane amount of thought and
brilliance, to movie and a dinner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
came to movie consensus after she claimed she would only accompany me on this
venture were we to see “I Hate You a Lot Die Die Die Like a Monkey in a Testing
Facility.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After an odd movie with no
point as far as my comprehension, we went back to her house for a barbecue she
insisted i would enjoy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We sat down at the
candelit table, she took off the blindfold, and served what she informed me to
be her favorite delicacy: pig’s head on a stick.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I prepare
to head back to the outer-city, wherein lies my house, when Woman informs me
that the wood needed to repair my boat will not arrive for a minimum of two
weeks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>This results in
my stumbling back into her lair, wading through piles of golden treasures
calling out “Woman!!?!?!</span> <span class=GramE>Where did you put my silver
slippers?!?!”</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She calls out to
me, allowing the knowledge of her whereabouts; the living room.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As i gently navigate myself into that good
night that is the presence of Woman, Brain’s consciousness waxes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I start to THINK that perhaps this
relationship is entirely one-sided, then the waning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>My presence
becomes found by the living room, and i ignorantly misconceive the reasons my
heart could possibly pulsate so quickly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This is love, i feel.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Woman is
sitting in an ominous chair.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the
wall, at her right hand lies an authentic “Luvalot” painting entitled, “The
Nazarene”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Without a word she delivers
to my person the materials necessary to vacate her premises.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From that point on, getting out of bed to use
the restroom just doesn’t seem worth it anymore.</p>
