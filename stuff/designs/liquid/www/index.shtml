            There are few minor defects that have to do with the grid in the 
            back not always lining up (especially below this Spotlight block... 
            but there's not much I can do about it and people will probably not 
            even notice it, so I'm leaving it as is. =P</font><p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2">Ummm... links on the side don't work 
            yet... and I'm going to have to make a &quot;standard layout&quot; page for 
            the other pages other than the frontpage (they will probably be 
            lacking the Spotlight section and not have a news section either)... 
            probably will just have one huge thing like the Spotlight section 
            minus the &quot;Spotlight&quot; title.</font></p>

            wanna leave the &quot;bubble burble...&quot; thing.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Oh also, let me know if there's 
            anything really hay-wire about the layout and what browser you're 
            using. I've tested it with IE6, and Phoenix 0.5/Mozilla. 
            Specifically, make sure that the Brook's belly pic is in the &quot;daily.photo.&quot; 
            tab thing and not crazy all over the page... that's mainly the only 
            thing I used CSS for, so it's probably the most likely thing to get 
            messed up.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Also, I used PNGs for all the 
            images... I *THINK* all major browsers can view them fine, but 
            again, let me know if it doesn't and what browser and all that other 
            junk.</font></p>
