        Van insisted that I play as another color besides green
        (which I like because it shows up as the same color as
        the tiberium on radar =)... so I chose pink as a joke. =)
        I started out top right as GDI. The map we played on had
        a lot of tiberium so I was almost never really low on
        cash.</font></td>

        another harvestor (gotta have that cash flow =). After I
        was done with that, I build a few titans, wolverines,
        etc. and started creating a small army. I still had not
        found Van's base due to the very weird terrain features
        of the map (only one way to Van's base and lots of hills,

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">This time, when I
        looked at his base, I noticed that he moved his
        construction yard (we had the &quot;un-deployable&quot;
        feature enabled). I guess he noticed me putting my
        engineers into my APC =)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">After going a little
        farther south, Van counter-attacked my army with a larger
        one. He destroyed my army with a few casualties on his
        side =( I must admit, I under-estimated Van =)</font></p>

        army. I tried to rush it south to capture a two
        structures with the engineers (a radar and a refinery
        were my targets), but Van destroyed the APC. Luckily, the
        engineers popped out safely and I rushed them south
        towards the two targeted structures. Van, knowing that he
        couldn't stop the engineers (they were out of his units'
        range) sold the radar and refinery and killed my
        engineers with the infantry that popped out of those two
        buildings. Well, I guess that's better than just nothing

    <tr>
        <td><font face="Arial">After a lot more time, I built
        another large army (including a Mammoth Mark II ;), an
        MCV, and a Orca Carry-All. I moved the army to the top
        left section of the map and carry-alled my MCV to the
        area. Van responded by sending his army to attack my army
        (and try to stop me from building a second base in the
        area I guess =). I quickly deployed my MCV and started
        constructing a second EMP cannon (the EMP was already
        fully charged from the first EMP cannon in my orginal
        base). I got it up just in time and EMPed Van's army!
        YES!!! =) Over 75% of his Titans were EMPed, leaving
        Van's army in a very bad shape (only 20+ infantry units,
        a few wolverines and three to five titans). I quickly
        rushed past his units and took out the Titans that were
        useless (before they went back online). After they were
        gone, I took out the rest of his army. During this time,
        I was so caught up in the action that I forgot to take
        screenshots =(. Sorry. =(</font><p><font face="Arial">During
        the battle, I built a barracks at my second base location
        and started pumping out disc throwers (I love those guys
        =) as reinforcement.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Unfortunately, by the time the MM2
        reached my army, the battle had already ended with my
        forces victorious. Ah well, he'll come in handy when I
        attack Van's main base =).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A few seconds later, two Orca
        bombers reached Van's base and bombed his EMP cannon so
        that my attack force would be safe when they went total
        offensive. I also remembered about my group of six
        jump-jet infantry who were annoying Van's harvestor. By
        this time, only one was left and I just sent it off to
        join my main attack force.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">After moving south, I destroyed the
        buildings that were left in Van's original location. He
        also sold many of them and I had to crush the infantry
        created from that action (annoying little pests =). Van
        had moved his MCV to the right about 20 squares so I sent
        my army in that direction. I also undeployed my
        construction yard which was located at my second base and
        carry-all'ed it south right above Van's second base.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Along the way, I had to take out 3
        (or 4?) distruptor tanks which were very annoying. Van
        also made a second ghostalker (his first one I destroyed
        when he tried attacking my base with it) which destroyed
        one or two titans I believe.</font></p>

        Van's second base. <br>
        Notice how he has not completed constructing his
        firestorm defense =)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">After putting
        up a very good fight. I was left with my MM2 and three
        Titans (yikes!).</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="3" face="Arial"><img
        src="Image13.jpg" width="380" height="261"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">I headed for
        his construction yard, which my MM2 took out with ease
        =). After taking out most of his base, I finished
        building a war factory above Van's base (with the MCV
        that I carry-all'ed over there) and a ghostalker. This is
        when Van gave up with the following message:</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="3" face="Arial"><img
        src="Image14.jpg" width="612" height="400"></font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="3" face="Arial">&quot;Sure&quot;
        Van, that's what they all say ;) Ack! And I only have one
        Titan left!</font></p>
