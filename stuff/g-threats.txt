"There 2 little kids, a boy and a girl, and they're playing in a little
sandbox outside The little boy decides he has to go pee, so he runs behind
some bushes and pottys The little girl decides she has to go to, so she runs
around like he did They look at each other and the girl goes, "What's THAT?"
the little boy says, "I don't know, but why don't you have one?" They're
both puzzled, but continue playing in their sandbox Later that day, the girl
tells her mom what happened and asks, "Mommy, what is that, and why don't I
have one?" Her mother replies, "Dear, what he has is a car... and what you
have is a garage... Don't EVER let a car into your garage, okay" so she says, 
"okay mommy" then the little boy talks to his dad about itand asks "what's this 
daddy, and Why doesn't SHE have one?" his dad responds, "Son, what you have 
is a car, and what she has is a garage. What you wanna do is get your car in as many
garages as possible, okay?" The kid says "okay" and they go on with their
day The next day, the kids play together in their sandbox again The parents
are sitting inside talking Then they hear this scream coming from outside
The parents rush out and find the little girl with her hands all bloody They
ask her what happened and she says... *drumroll* "He tried to put his car in
my garage so I took his wheels off.""

"so just think of that joke..." "and now think of whether or not you want to
test me"

"if my yearbook pic is up.... well... then your wheels can say byebye to
your car" "okie dokie?"

"I'll kick you so hard your cup will be shoved... "
