        </span>Boo! AH! I’m a bug! That is basically what happens in Franz
        Krafka’s <u>The Metamorphosis</u>. What a dumb pathetic book.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The author should be caught and burned at the stake, after being
        bagged and beaten beforehand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Actually,
        let’s just bag all the literary professors because Krafka was probably
        just some idiot like Minix who came up with some stupid bug story…
        then some “smart” literary dude came along and said “Oh lala…
        look at all this symbolic junk.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>What a retard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Everyone
        should give him wedgies and swirlies and spit spit-balls at him.&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoHeader" style="text-indent:.5in;tab-stops:.5in"><span style="font-family:Arial">Now
        for my real essay… nevermind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
        want to talk about my view-point on these stupid essays first.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>First of all, the “awesome” authors of these “wonderful”
        literary works of “art” are probably morons who just decided to
        write a story about things like bugs, pigs, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The “smart” ones used plenty of literary techniques and other
        junk like that along with much vocabulary in order confuse the heck out
        of the reader.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Why do you
        think you have to read a poem two, three, or more times before you even
        begin to understand it? That’s not what I call literary merit,
        that’s literary confusion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
        these “masterful” authors are not really masterful at all, but
        rather stink greatly at the use of the English language to get across a
        point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For that, they
        should be bagged, beaten, and burned at the stake.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoHeader" style="text-indent:.5in;tab-stops:.5in"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;Now
        for my second point, the goofy scholarly people who find a bunch of
        useless garbage in the “masterful” authors’ works of “art.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>These are such people who write the AP test, the SAT, and other
        such items which attempt to test one’s intellectual skill of BSing
        using the English language.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Does
        anyone really need to know what Krafka’s bug might represent in our
        society? I think not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
        these people should be bagged, beaten, and burned at the stake.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoHeader" style="text-indent:.5in;tab-stops:.5in"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;Forget
        my third topic paragraph - that was taught to me by mindless teachers (except for Ms.K and Ms.Hengst of course 'cause I don't wanna be bagged, beaten, and burned at the stake... or fail English... heh =)
        who just read stuff in a book written by the goofy looking scholarly
        people.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoHeader" style="text-indent:.5in;tab-stops:.5in"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">In
        conclusion, these people who all they like to do is torture teenage
        minds with useless tasks such as identifying and listing rhetorical
        devices and literary techniques, should be bagged, beaten, and burned at
        the stake… then fed to the wild dogs in the woods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Beat that! Now find the symbolism in this piece of junk which
        will someday be called a masterful work of literary merit and forced
        upon future teenage minds to scramble useless jargon and fake symbolic
        references in the year 2165 AD.</span></p>
