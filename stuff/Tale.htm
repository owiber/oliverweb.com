A Prologue's Prologue<br>
<br>
&quot;Once upon a time,&quot; many stories do begin.<br>
But this one is different; get ready for a spin.<br>
Crammed with a plethora of lame rhymes,<br>
And pointless lines sure to waste your time.<br>
Read the rest of this story,<br>
And you will soon see - our attempt at Douglas Adams glory.<br>
<br>
Prologue<br>
<br>
Our story begins on a summer day within a genius' testing chamber,<br>
Filled with spinning gizmos and gleaming gadgets, I do remember.<br>
Bulging with charts of the cosmos upon the walls,<br>
It did appear like some space-age academy hall. <br>
<br>
Amidst the instruments the Lazy Genius sat,<br>
He is the king technocrat.<br>
One can easily look and infer,<br>
There is no aspect of technology he is not master.<br>
Though knowing all the mysteries of the universe,<br>
Being a lazy bum is his only curse.<br>
Owning devices of such great scientific relevance,<br>
They are strewn about despite his great intelligence.<br>
Never bothering to clean up his messy lab,<br>
He rather just to doodle on his notepad.<br>
He knows the mysteries of the cosmos sure enough,<br>
But he never bothers to do anything because of his sloth.<br>
His white hair is a mess, much like a slob of spaghetti that no one wants to 
eat.<br>
He dressed in dirty lab coats, with purple slippers on his feet.<br>
The Genius' face and body was tired and worn,<br>
As physical exercise, he looked upon with scorn.<br>
Below his chest, there was a decent size potbelly,<br>
Which seemed to jiggle around like a pile of strawberry-jelly. <br>
<br>
Next I shall describe this particularly cool guy,<br>
It is none other than me, myself, I.<br>
At first glance, they say I look like a punk,<br>
However my values and beliefs are closer to a monk's.<br>
I wear upon my head a multicolored mohawk.<br>
Which seemingly separates me from the rest of society's flock.<br>
People who judge me as a gangster at first sight do sometimes flee.<br>
Little do they know I volunteer and do charity.<br>
I have studied vector calculus and Shakespeare's Hamlet,<br>
Yet because of my teenage appearance prejudices do beget.<br>
I'm the professor's nephew sent to his house to look and learn,<br>
Although the Lazy Genius treats me like some summer intern.<br>
Charged with cleaning his huge lab room,<br>
He's just too lazy to do it himself, that buffoon.<br>
Though I despise straightening up the clutter,<br>
I commence without even a mutter.<br>
Being bossed around makes me a tad tense,<br>
Even so, it is all good experience.<br>
I dress the way I am to let one see,<br>
Outside appearances can skew perception quite deceivingly.<br>
While strangers may think I'm some child gone funk.<br>
People who know me call me the Good Punk.<br>
<br>
Consumed with boredom while cleaning one day in Lazy Genius' messy lab,<br>
Where the Genius is but doodling on his notepad.<br>
&quot;How about we go to the beach?&quot; I suggest.<br>
The Genius replies, &quot;That sounds like a dandy idea! I think that would be best.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Let me test my instant-transporter really quick…<br>
If it works, we won't have to worry about traffic.&quot;<br>
&quot;Bbzzzooooottttt Zrreeeee&quot; the Instant-Transporter whirred as the room filled 
with fumes.<br>
As the gas dispersed, two new figures were apparent in the room.<br>
<br>
One was tall, muscular and smelled slightly like a pig-filled pigsty.<br>
He was from long ago so we called him The Braveheart Guy.<br>
His appearance one can easily see,<br>
Is that of someone straight from the movie.<br>
Adorn with leather armor and an elaborately carved bronze shield.<br>
A large shimmering steel broad sword he also did wield. <br>
Bemired with mud coming out of the warp hole,<br>
Obviously he has no difficulty battling in rain or snow.<br>
A towering figure of incredible height,<br>
He was equally blessed with high might.<br>
Equally matched even with the monsters in Lock Ness,<br>
He is a symbol of manliness.<br>
Being such a gritty guy,<br>
There was something out of character in his eyes.<br>
In those orbs of ultramarine blue,<br>
They seem to be some strange clue.<br>
Not violent and angry but seemingly… kind.<br>
Oh, how it did boggle the mind!<br>
Is there something else beyond the rugged exterior, something more?<br>
We will find out when he tells his lore.<br>
Anyhow when he first tumbled through the warp, rumbling with a war cry,<br>
I never really got a chance to look at his eyes.<br>
Not knowing which century he suddenly appeared in,<br>
He pulled out the battle-ax and gave it a spin.<br>
Equipment shivered as glass beneath his slash.<br>
The transporter machine he sadly, also bashed.<br>
Using is multilingual skills Lazy got him to relax.<br>
Finally to lower that devastating battle ax.<br>
The professor soon befriended the tall figure with pride.<br>
It soon became apparent that Braveheart Guy would follow along to the seaside.<br>
<br>
The other figure, unsure of at first, turned out to be some sort of alien blob.<br>
The green and ugly pile of gunk just stood and stared until it said, &quot;Greetings. 
My name is Bob.&quot;<br>
Bob was very gooey indeed; he looked much like play-do mixed with mud.<br>
He might have a hand or eyes, or maybe even feet, but I couldn't tell if he was 
a wimp or a stud.<br>
It was unknown whether he was sitting or standing, sleeping or glaring.<br>
Bob was basically, just a green blob, touched only by those very daring.<br>
As Lazy and I stood in shock, Bob wiggled along the floor like a leech.<br>
Finally, with much haste, Lazy replied, &quot;We are Earthlings, would you like to go 
to the beach?&quot;<br>
<br>
So off they went, this unusual quartet of ours, to see the beach and bathe in 
the sun.<br>
I'm not sure with this gang if it's going to be much fun.<br>
Seeing that Mr. Braveheart killed the instant-transporter machine,<br>
We had to get there by some other means.<br>
&quot;How 'bout you take my super-cool-spaceship?&quot;<br>
Lazy Genius added, &quot;With a coffee maker, it's quite well equipped.&quot;<br>
So we climbed aboard the craft resembling a bullet with wings.<br>
However the professor was too lazy to leave his cushioned chair with springs.<br>
&quot;Go on without me for now&quot;<br>
&quot;I'll fix the transporter and catch up later,&quot; he said with a bow.<br>
So we three blasted off into the stratosphere,<br>
However, boredom soon set in once again as I feared.<br>
I popped in my favorite Nine Inch Nose Hairs CD,<br>
And listened to the &quot;tunes&quot; with glee.<br>
Suddenly on the control console,<br>
Lazy Genius's holographic-communicator image did switch on and glow.<br>
&quot;Seeing that everyone has nothing to do.&quot;<br>
&quot;How 'bout we tell a tale or two?&quot;<br>
&quot;Let's make it a contest, shall we not?&quot;<br>
&quot;To the winner I will give one of my inventions which cannot be easily bought.&quot;<br>
&quot;Now if you don't tell a tale today, it will be seen,&quot;<br>
&quot;That you will receive not a drop of sunscreen.&quot;<br>
&quot;Because I know everything I guess I'll judge&quot;<br>
&quot;To those not victorious, I hope you won't hold a grudge.&quot;<br>
Seeing that we had nothing else to do,<br>
I volunteered to be speaker number two.<br>
Braveheart guy also agreed with a nod,<br>
The alien, Bob, gurgled and bubbled, &quot;yes&quot; within his restraining pod.<br>
To get things started the Lazy Genius will speak,<br>
I hope his tale isn't filled with technical jargon that will make it bleak.<br>
<br>
Lazy Genius' Tale's Prologue<br>
<br>
My story will begin many centuries away,<br>
In the far off galaxy of Nozz, I have been there just a few days.<br>
My magnificent time-travel machine I have used,<br>
I've seen many wonders that I will now share with you.<br>
<br>
There once was a turtle named Bob,<br>
(Not like the alien blob we have here, but an alien turtle, Bob.)<br>
The turtle was very very slow,<br>
But this story really has nothing to do with a turtle and more with a person 
named Poe…<br>
<br>
Lazy Genius' Tale<br>
<br>
In the far-off galaxy of Nozz, there was an evil general named Poe.<br>
General Poe was mean. He was nasty. He was really really low.<br>
His goal in life was to rule the universe and everything within.<br>
In this conquest of many planets, he wore planets' resources very thin.<br>
<br>
He overpowered the Terran, he destroyed the Protoss empire.<br>
Even the mighty and many Zerg fell to his wicked aspire.<br>
He went from galaxy to galaxy, blowing away suns, planets, and moons.<br>
Causing great chaos to all living things from alien Martians to alien baboons.<br>
<br>
After a decade of constant conquest, General Poe thought all was won.<br>
Until a little boy brought up an idea; just a little one.<br>
&quot;I thought you conquered everything,&quot; the boy thought.<br>
&quot;What about that black hole there?&quot; pointing to a map of all the battles fought.<br>
<br>
At first the General thought of it nonsense,<br>
But wait! He must conquer everything he thought… &quot;On with the offense!&quot;<br>
He gathered his troops, his spaceships and guns,<br>
Off to battle a foe, a black hole, dubbed Attila-The-Hun.<br>
<br>
So off he went with his battalion of fleets, zooming off into the distance with 
a great buzz.<br>
His strategists surveyed the enemy and concluded that it was,<br>
Too great an enemy, impossible to defeat!<br>
They cried out that it was like kicking a metal pole with your bare feet!<br>
<br>
But Poe was too greedy, too prideful a man,<br>
He ordered his troops to attack, so off they ran.<br>
One by one they approached the event horizon,<br>
And disappeared forever, never to grow old or even wizen.<br>
<br>
As his fleet was approaching its depletion,<br>
Poe himself struggled for his victory's completion.<br>
Off he went in his flagship cruiser…<br>
Off to make the black hole the battle's loser.<br>
<br>
But as you can guess, Attila got the best,<br>
And Poe disappeared with all the rest.<br>
So as you have learned, never be too prideful or full of greed,<br>
Rather than kill and blow up, help others with kind helpful deeds.<br>
<br>
Back to the ship<br>
<br>
So that was Lazy Genius' story he just told.<br>
Now it's my turn, listen and behold…<br>
<br>
Good Punk's Tale<br>
<br>
I begin a tale about rules and regulations,<br>
With morals applicable in any nation.<br>
Let me introduce the characters of this tale then,<br>
It is a story of two holy men.<br>
They are monks on a pilgrimage to somewhere I don't know,<br>
Traveling to where ever the wind does flow.<br>
One man is very strict in abiding by the rules,<br>
Someone not following them to the book is a fool.<br>
That was his stern old philosophy,<br>
Now his younger partner was different; he was quite free.<br>
The rules of the holy men he doesn't care for quite as much,<br>
Chastity and giving up worldly possessions and such.<br>
Now don't get me wrong; this young guy is quite loyal,<br>
Never does he dream of breaking those rules in his toils.<br>
He lives life by what standards his conscience deems right,<br>
Doesn't have to keep the holy books and scriptures always in sight.<br>
Wandering in the woods one fateful day,<br>
The two happened to hear cries of help ahead on their way.<br>
Rushing through the tall grasses winding and curled,<br>
In the open pasture was a figure of a maiden girl.<br>
She lay broken and weeping upon the wet ground,<br>
Around her ankle a silk handkerchief was crudely bound.<br>
The urgent matter is what lies below,<br>
Where an adder had given her two deep holes.<br>
Upon the wet earth where she was found,<br>
There were rips and wide tears upon her bemired gown. <br>
It seems she faced worse ordeals last night,<br>
Compounded with that poisonous snakebite.<br>
The younger monk came quickly to her aid,<br>
While the elder reluctantly behind he stayed.<br>
Appalled feelings in the elder it did provoke,<br>
When the younger covered the sobbing girl with his own cloak.<br>
The younger tried to help her upon her feet,<br>
However it proved to be an impossible feat.<br>
Shocked was the elder when the younger took the maiden on his back,<br>
Written in the scriptures: holy men and women shouldn't have physical contact.<br>
&quot;Shouldn't we holy men wait and get someone else to help?&quot;<br>
Stated the elder with a slight yelp.<br>
&quot;Nonsense, brother!&quot; the younger said.<br>
&quot;She requires medical attention; look how her ankle has bled.&quot;<br>
At mid-day the three arrived at a nearby town.<br>
A doctor's clinic they also found.<br>
On a hospital bed the poor maiden they set her down to lay,<br>
Their job done, the holy men set off once again on their way.<br>
That night the both men set up camp on the ground,<br>
The younger slept quite happy and sound.<br>
However, the elder was up throughout the night,<br>
Burdened with his mental plight.<br>
At last he reached a point he cannot stand,<br>
He went and roused up the younger man.<br>
&quot;Didn't we take our vow of strict separation between man and woman, brother?&quot;<br>
The elder said between stutters.<br>
The younger sat up with great composure,<br>
While the other's mind was a stirred. <br>
&quot;Brother, I left that poor girl all the way back at town with the forest near,<br>
But you, my friend, have brought her all the way here.<br>
Don't take every rule at face value,<br>
That is advice I can gladly tell you.<br>
We vowed to refrain from worldly love and lust within the mind,<br>
If our minds are pure, what's the harm of slight contact of the physical kind?&quot;<br>
The free one went soundly back to sleep,<br>
While the other sat pondering in a human heap.<br>
From Buddhist scriptures that story I did read,<br>
However it is applicable to everyone no matter your creed.<br>
<br>
Bob's Tale<br>
<br>
Look at me, this green blob of mine,<br>
Do you think I need sunscreen to protect my slime?<br>
I choose not to tell a tale,<br>
Because I need as much sunscreen as a blue whale.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Back to the ship<br>
<br>
&quot;Well Bob turned out to be a bad sport,&quot;<br>
Muttered Lazy with a snort.<br>
No sunscreen to Bob we will lend,<br>
How bout we listen to Mr. Braveheart now then?<br>
<br>
Braveheart Guy's Tale<br>
<br>
As I drink thee wonderful coffee,<br>
I wonder if it is caffeine free.<br>
&quot;No it's not.&quot;<br>
Well, at least it's hot.<br>
Thus, I shalt tell my story to thee,<br>
A tale from my homeland, little piggies three.<br>
There once were three little pigs,<br>
And a wolf very very big.<br>
Hold on, let me get more sweet coffee in my cup.<br>
This stuff I just can't get enough!<br>
Anyway, the pigs left home,<br>
They all planned to live alone.<br>
One pig made a house of straw,<br>
It was very cheap, after all.<br>
The other made a house of sticks.<br>
And the last made a strong house of bricks.<br>
More coffee please,<br>
So I can finish my tale with ease.<br>
Now the wolf felt quite hungry,<br>
So he wanted to eat the piggies three.<br>
I'm tired of talking and telling this tale,<br>
I'll jump to the end so I can drink coffee by the pails.<br>
The wolf was tired of huffing and puffing,<br>
Aye, talking in verse is such a curse!<br>
So he left the pigs alone in the strong brick house,<br>
And went home to drink coffee.<br>
There.<br>
<br>
Epilogue<br>
<br>
Maybe I was wrong about that man's eyes,<br>
To coffee he became addicted, that is no lie.<br>
I thought his eyes were bright at first,<br>
But in coffee they seemed now immersed.<br>
<br>
Now let's wait to see what the prize will be,<br>
The Lazy Genius now we will see.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now that I have heard all the tales,<br>
I will announce the winner of us four males.<br>
The prize is my special coffee maker you see,<br>
Not needed by him, you, or me.<br>
<br>
So I will announce Braveheart as our winner,<br>
His own coffee beans he can now simmer.<br>
Congrats to you, my man of old ages,<br>
This is sure to calm your many angry rages.<br>
<br>
So we arrived at the beach under the sun,<br>
With the transporter fixed, Lazy also had lots of fun.<br>
But after the day had ended,<br>
It was necessary to make sure the task of sending everyone home was tended.<br>
<br>
So into the transporter our two new friends went,<br>
One back to his planet, the other to his home in a tent…<br>
And back at his home, the scream was heard among many piglets,<br>
&quot;AHHHH!!!! THERE ARE NO OUTLETS!!!!&quot;<br>
Too bad electrical power had not been invented,<br>
Until well beyond the Seventeen-hundreds. <br>
