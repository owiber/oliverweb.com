I really don't have the desire... it's just a personal hobby now, so I'll just have fun with it when I feel like it. =)<!--ktalk end_comment--></font></td>

      <font face=arial size=2><!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Sean end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Oliver, you have no audience and your comic is currently in a state of crap. Throughout the year you presented several funny comics and many that were inside jokes. I followed MrTechHappy hoping that you would soon learn how to soot through the before mentioned crap comics and focus instead on hte good ones that you are capable of producing. What I would like to see in the future if you ever do start up the comics again is a clear effort to stear away from inside jokes and from throwing togethor a comic just to have one up. I think several times your best comics would come up after  a period of no updates. Whenever you had the time and were willing to put forth the effort you actually had a good online comic. ALso, please in the next comic create entirely new charachters, not based off yoursleves or anyone else that you know. Often this would lead you to make fun of someone, usually viraj, in a way that myself and other people tat knew him would find hilarious ( viraj dress up day for example ) but someone else looking in would jsu thtink was stupid. I showed the site to a couple of my friends who read online comics at atm but they never really enjoyed it, usually complaining of too many inside jokes. SOmetime this summer you need to rework the entire techhappy comic and start developing charachters that you feel could present you with an opportunity to actually put out some worthwhile stuff. Later. <!--ktalk end_comment--></font></td>

I know that technically Mark Brook and Van are also all members... but... I mean... come on, you're the only one who will do something, and we're counting on you!  <br><br>And as to the three finger salute thing, by doing a guest comic, you'd be introducing people to MrTechhappy,  not for fame, but rather to bring happiness into their lives!!  I'm sure there are people out there now, on the brink of depression, where all they need, is a comic strip featuring smushed little characters, battling giant lizards for no particular reason, to bring them back to the realm of happiness, but they cant find you... but fine, fine!  Be selfish, don't introduce them to your comic!  Let them get depressed, let their life be ruined!!  I hope you're happy with your neglect... =(  meanwhile, i'll just weep for them...<!--ktalk end_comment--></font></td>
