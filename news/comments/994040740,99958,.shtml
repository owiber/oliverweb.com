<p><b><font face="arial" color="#003399"></font> </b><font face="arial" size="1">Sunday, July 1, 2001 <!--(9:25:40)--></font><br><font size="2" face="arial">Bravo man... really, I "applaud" you. You've been successful in deleting a few quotes and memories from OliverWEB. Great job, really. I don't know if I could have done it better myself.<br><br>I could just email this to you, but I know you'll read it here. I've got nothing to hide, perhaps you do? I could very well go through every strand of OliverWEB and take off every reference of you... how would you like that? I won't... I'll be the bigger man right now. I won't lower myself to your level. Getting pissed yet? You have a problem with that. Read on. Perhaps you should think through things a bit more before you actually do things. That's a novel idea, <i>think</i>. Wow. <br><br>You need help man, I'm sorry... I don't think I can anymore. Perhaps you've forgotten all the times I've tried. After all this, do you still not see clearly, are you still all tangled up in your pride? Wow, you're 18 now... that makes you a man, right? Yeah, just like how wearing that black belt makes you a super cool martial arts dude. Let me tell you something. And make sure you listen and understand, because you've probably had some trouble thinking lately. It means <i>nothing</i>. Nothing at all. Think you're a man? Can handle your own life? Deep within, you're not a man, you're a whining little brat foul mouthing every person around him because things didn't go your way.<br><br>Stop trying to control people... you can't, you won't, and you'll only end up screwing your own life up while hurting others in the process. Am I pissed right now? Yes. Another congratulations to you man, you got Oliver mad. Few have been able to achieve that task. That make you the best? The smartest dude ever? Give me a break. You didn't even "hack" into OliverWEB. You *knew* my quote page password... that's smart thinking there, let me tell you. You broke a trust, have I ever broken a trust to hurt you?<br><br>Perhaps you weren't the one who messed with the page? Let's look into this, shall we? You knew my password. It was a few days/hours (I don't know, I was in Dallas) after I erased your account(s) on OliverWEB, so you have a motive. "To each his own..." has you written all over it. Perhaps it wasn't you? No, scratch that idea. <br><br>I urge you to look within yourself and see how truly twisted you are right now. There's a song that goes "humble thyself in the sight of the Lord"... maybe you've sung it before? You should listen to the words from your own mouth. Really, you should. I said I was mad, but do I hate you? No, I will never hate you no matter what you do. I am sorry for you, I'm sorry our friendship has gotten to become like this, I'm sorry there <i>is no friendship</i> anymore.<br><br>May God be with you and open your eyes. You'll need Him.<br><br>-To the others reading this, please don't add any "scolding" in the comments. Let this be.<br><b>-<a href="mailto:oliver@oliverweb.com">Oliver</a></b></font><br>

I remember quite well the day I saw this post from Oliver, and thought, oh boy, what the heck did I get myself into now, then when everyone started writing all this crap, I felt really responsible for everything getting out of control, but I held back, and did not respond once. I thought it was pretty interesting how &quot;BIG&quot; the topic of me really was. Of course I was not proud of it, but nevertheless, it was interesting. Now...since a LONG time has gone by, I figured I would return to the scene of the crime and read up on the past while finally adding a post. Funny finding you here Minix. And also funny how it wasn't that long ago that you were here. Anyways, in case anyone ever does come here that actually posted stuff below, I just wanna say that I am glad things got worked out for the most part, and that I am glad we are all for the most part friends now.

Its supposed to be really competitve to get into, but if that is what you wanna do you should go look into it. The program is part of the architecture colleg (dont ask me why) but its all comp sci and ee stuff. The comp sci guy told us all the guys out of it get hired like immedialty by disney and pixar and all those type of companies. He was tlaking about one guy who wrote the program that did this little animation where two guys are playing chess or something and they have all these different expressions on their faces. It was supposed to show how to do al the expressions that could be in some movie, but the guy ened up winning like an academy award for the little animation. The whole program sounded pretty cool. You should look into it. I was thinking about doing that program/minor thing where they try to get you into the graphics stuff but I dont know. <!--ktalk end_comment--></font></td>

Did you, or did you not hear from Ochs about the karate incident..., him lying to me about &quot;only liking me&quot; and me being the fool girl I was believing him... Maybe I do think, alex, that you don't know Ochs for very long. When I first met him, I thought he was nice and all. Like Matt said, I should've seen through the crazy stuff he was doing to Sarah H. But anyway... I've known Ochs a lot longer.. he's the kind of person you have to know for a long while to really see... I'm not blaming you at all =) Because... of course.. I was &quot;fooled&quot; at first too... but... I really believe he was the one who gets on my sister's screen name, I don't see anybody else who would, do you? <br>I forgot who, but either you or Sean or both talk about how we need to end this, we need to move on right? Well.. if about 60% of the time, Ochs is talking about how we all &quot;used&quot; to be friends, he's not moving on so well is he? Maybe you guys need to talk to HIM about moving on, hm? Sigh... I'm sorry, but... yeah... this all has gone way out of hand... and maybe if Ochs is telling you guys all of this stuff... being so sad about our friendship and whatever junk he's saying... where is he in all of this? Or are you guys his little messengers? Not that I'm asking for him to post anything, I'm just curious. Oh well, it doesn't matter and I could care less, I just hate seeing people believing the wrong thing so strongly.<br>btw...

Me, Chad, Oliver, and Ochs... thats all that ever had the pw...  It was deleted by getting into the account, and then changing email... there were a total of 6 bands under that name and pw... the other 5 are still there, only NINH is gone... yes, he was kicked out a long time ago... but that doesnt mean he didnt lose the pw.  It happened right after the karate studio... gee...  kind of suspicious...  I know it wasn't me.  I know it wasn't Chad or Oliver... I trust them both with my life... however, I can't trust Ochs...<br><br>I don't blame anyone for taking Ochs's side... if they've only heard the story from Ochs... I was his friend for awhile, I know he lies and manipulates the truth all the time... and I fell for it for a long long time...  Sarah H. for instance... ugh... I took his side, listened to him on it... I should've realized then he was a mentally unstable.  I really do think he has mental problems, and desperately needs help...  <br><br>I seriously don't understand why anyone however would try and make Oliver out to be the bad guy in any of this though... I can attest that he did try and be Ochs's friend, he listened to him, and tried to salvage the friendship... if anything, Ochs threw it away... Yeah, Oliver did have strong words in his post... but... at this point, I think it was called for... a lot of us should've told Ochs to get a grip a lot earlier...<br><br>What I think is funny... is that some of you are making Ochs out to be the victim... like he didn't do some pretty stupid stupid stuff... he deleted the quotes... In my opinion, I know he deleted Nine Inch Nose Hairs... in the past i've given him the benefit of the doubt, but he's not deserving of that anymore... I believe that he is the only one who would get onto Oriana's screen name... having seen the buddy list... yeah... no one else would care... <br><br>I want this to die as much as anyone else... I keep hoping I never see or hear from him again... in any form or fashion.  I sure didn't ask that he delete the quotes page or NINH, or try to get on other peoples accounts...  thats all his doing.<br><br>Another thing worth mentioning... think Ochs isn't getting on other peoples accounts?  Melissa, his sister IM'ed me one day, telling me to block two of her screen names, because Ochs had been getting on to see if we were getting on.  She called Olivia to tell her to block the screen names as well... When Ochs found out about Melissa doing this, he got mad, and got in an argument with his mom, because now he couldnt check to see if we were on... sigh... want to prove that one?  Go ask his parents.<br><br>His stepdad also called me... warning me, that if Ochs were to come to my door, or try and speak to me somewhere, I should avoid him in any way I could... this is his family... not some bystander who hardly knows him...<br><br>also... Ochs has the ability to get on AIM at work I believe?  I've seen his sn on with an away message saying he was off doing something at work... gee... I sincerely doubt he's busy all the time, so that he can't get on an account for half a minute to do some spying... <br><br>Ok... I think this comment has run its course... but... seriously, I think the only one to blame for any of this right now... is Ochs.<br><br>(An old favorite quote of Ochs's... &quot;What goes around comes around&quot;  if so, he's got a lot to look forward to (completely sarcastic))<!--ktalk end_comment--></font></td>

I've tried so hard, but I dunno, this whole thing is way out of hand now.. and it all started because of me (basically).<br><br>I do not understand why, sean and alex, that you are putting all this blame on Oliver and Matt. Hello? Is Ochs not feeding you guys the right information? Oh.. wait.. of course not.. since.. you know.. you guys found all your info out from HIM.. most likely... not thinking that what he could be telling you guys might *not* be how it is or the whole story. Have you heard the whole story by chance?<br><br>This whole mess started with me ending my relationship with Ochs. I had no idea it would turn into this whole mess. Personally, I wanted to have a nice friendship with Ochs afterwards, but... not anymore now. So, did you guys ever happen to hear how this whole thing blew up? Ever heard of Ochs losing his temper and control at my house when he was picking Oliver and me up for school? I bet not... See what you think of this. Ochs wanted to apologize for something he had said to one of my good friends and I was like, &quot;Oh, okay, sure, he's trying to be nice&quot;. <br>&quot;Sit down, Olivia, I want to talk to you.&quot;<br>&quot;Oh, it's okay Ochs.. I think I'll stand right here..&quot;<br>&quot;No, please, sit down next to me.&quot;<br>&quot;No.. I can hear you just find from right here.&quot;<br>This went on for about 10 minutes, him asking me to sit down next to him and me refusing to because I thought that just standing 2 feet away from him was good enough, don't you? Not for him I suppose. He started cussing at me and ran out of the house telling me to find my own ride to school. I resisted and all the way to school, Ochs drove recklessly, running stop signs, speeding... not what I call a good habit. This sound familiar boys? Why dont' you ask your good friend Ochs... and see if this is true or not. If he denies, you know he's lying. <br><br>I can't say I blame either of you totally.. for what you have written since you have been only told by one source what is going on. I have made the mistake many times of not finding out the story from both people. The only thing I totally blame you two are not finding out our view on things. Is Ochs that trustworthy to you two? Maybe so, but Sean, I know you know my brother... do you really think Oliver would go loopy like this? I dont think so. <br><br>It upsets me very much that everybody is attacking Oliver and Matt. Um, hello? All they were were friends of Ochs that decided to be his friend on account of me, basically. Why get mad at them? They haven't done anything wrong. So stop bashing them... find out what they have to say first. Dont' go calling my brother a bad Christian for what he is doing. I believe my brother is doing the best thing he could do. I've heard Ochs claim he's a Christian. Can you claim he's being a good one? Did YOU hear about the karate incident? If you haven't, Ochs has, yet again, neglected to mention an important detail of this whole ordeal. <br><br>I think it's my turn now, to explain one of the &quot;accusations&quot;... The AOL screen name.<br><br>Alright.. tell me who else would get onto a 9 year old's (my sister) screen name... have enough time to try to guess her password... and sign on then off about almost every morning. Who else.. would block every single name that was on there except Minix's and mine. Another thing... I've had a new screen name for not *that* long, and I know that I got it AFTER my sister stopped using the sn &quot;oreockkie6&quot;. So my new sn was NOT on my sister's buddy list. But, WALLA! It suddenly appears on Oreockkie6's buddy list! How did that happen? None of us has done it. And it's definetly not my sister signing on and off Oreockkie6.. usually when that sn signs on.. Oriana's computer is turned off and she is most likely IN MY ROOM. Hm.. I wonder who would block everybody's screen name except my *new* name and Minix's, who Ochs seems to have developed an great &quot;dislike&quot; for since Minix is one of my best friends. Think about it boys.<br><br>I don't want to sound mean or anything of the sort here... but.. Sean.. Alex.. maybe you two need to come talk to the other side before judging us.<br><br>Alright.. I think this post is long enough.. sorry my writing is sloppy and not well thought of... I wont' hide that I am mad. <br><br>Like Oliver said.. I'd really like to end this whole mess.. and I thought we had all moved on a long time ago... but seems like Ochs hasn't. <br><br><!--ktalk end_comment--></font></td>

However, after a majority of the past incidents, I was never asked to talk with him. I would be willing to, but if I did, I'd like the truth and actions to back it up. I never, ever, said anything about not being willing to talk.<br><br>&quot;And this accusing him of using yalls names is bullshit.&quot;<br><br>Alright, if you're referring to &quot;knew my password&quot; and the posting of the quote under my name... that was the only way possible Ochs could have done anything to the page. I have the page before I uploaded my back-up and can send it to you and/or a screenshot if you would like. He used my name... not that that's a huge thing in itself, but he did. Don't call me a liar without proof to back it up.<br><br>&quot;Your going out of your way to be an asshole.&quot;<br><br>By doing what? Finally expressing the way I really feel about his actions? Telling the truth? I never made anything up, again, don't call me a liar.<br><br>&quot;Talk to matt and explain where you are coming from and let him do the same.&quot;<br><br>I'm open, although at this point, an email conversation would probably be best. But I don't think I really have much explaining to do.<br><br>&quot;This whole ordeal is pathetic, all of you involved.&quot;<br><br>I agree, but Sean... perhaps you and I need to talk, have you only talked with Ochs?<!--ktalk end_comment--></font></td>

Make sure you know the whole &quot;story&quot; first and from both perspectives.<br><br>2. As Minix said, Ochs not only put up a quote, but deleted all the others. I'm sorry, but I took that as a personal attack and insult.<br><br>3. I have NEVER... NEVER intentionally hurt Ochs in the past and have tried talking to him on multiple occasions. If in fact, I did hurt him, I'm sorry. I've tried to be as neutral as I can throughout this whole ordeal, do you know how hard it is to be torn between a former best friend and family? I'm sorry, but I've been hurt by Ochs multiple times in the past and throughout many of them, I've tried to be kind and talk. I recommended against the whole relationship (Ochs+Olivia) from the beginning and talked to Ochs a few times about it, everytime I was basically ignored. A few months ago, we talked and I asked him how he felt about Olivia. I told him that if he still thought he &quot;loved&quot; her and was still persuing her, that there wasn't any chance of our friendship repairing itself. He told he &quot;he wasn't sure how he felt&quot;... yet later, multiple times, he's told other people that he &quot;loved&quot; her and realized how much he &quot;cared for her.&quot; I didn't do anything then, but that hurt.<br><br>4. I'm not totally blaming Ochs. The blame is not entirely on him, and I believe that other people were unjust and unfair towards him. I do, however, believe that this has gone too far because of his actions. He needs to let go. I've never gotten angry at him and the times we've talked about our friendship, I've tried to be kind. After NINH was deleted and the &quot;karate incident&quot;, I decided that Ochs' ability to edit pages on OliverWEB should be deleted. For my site's &quot;protection&quot; and because... well, quite frankly, our friendship was dead... it was bound to happen sooner or later. Perhaps Ochs took it as an attack on him, I'm sorry if he did. Attacking me personally was the last straw and I got angry. He insulted me on the internet, so I did the same.<br><br>5. Yes, my &quot;letter&quot; was pretty much a lot of cut-downs. I think Ochs needs to hear it. I, for one, have had enough of his crying and tears and &quot;I'm sorry&quot;. &quot;I'm sorry&quot; doesn't mean anything when the actions don't follow. The latter half of my &quot;letter&quot;, there was a shift (if small, it's still there). If my message was skewed and not clear enough, here is what I want to say: &quot;Ochs, I think your mind is clouded right now. Our friendship is gone in the sense that enjoying time with each other is nonexistent. I still care, and I didn't mean to convey the message that I hate you or anything like that. I think you're beyond the help I can give and need to work things through mentally within yourself right now.&quot;<br><br>I'm going to post this and respond to a few or your lines...<!--ktalk end_comment--></font></td>

I'm going to try and approach this with good humor =)<br><br>Because you've probably not been informed of a lot of stuff... I think Im going to explain some... then maybe you'll understand a little bit more<br><br>1st... Ochs didnt just put a quote on the quote page, but deleted a lot... yeah, not a big deal... lets go further =)<br><br>2nd... You mightve heard of Nine Inch Nose Hairs... Ochs deleted all that stuff off the internet, and changed the account email address to another one, so that none of us could get in... a lot of my stuff is up on these accounts.<br><br>3rd... maybe not last, even though it was last in the comment... but Im curious... I dont remember ever ever claiming Ochs threatened me... what the heck?<br><br>I would have to say I am with Oliver... you reach a point, where dealing with someone becomes too big a hassle... you hope they get better, but it rips at you too much to deal with it... and its not a matter of being a christian either... I view what Olivers doing as being very christian... theres a song by DC Talk, called &quot;It's Killing Me&quot;  I view that as similar to this...<br><br>4th, something I gotta mention that Ochs did that was retarded... he's been getting on Orianas screen name... doesnt this seem illegal... or atleast incredibly childish?  Olivia got on the other day to change pw... couldn't, but on the list, all names were blocked but two, mine and hers... lala... stupid stupid...<br><br>Not to be a jerk or anything, maybe I am... but... I never want a friendship with Ochs again... thats just speaking for myself... I want him to be ok... get over everything, and live a happy productive life... but... I dont want to be a part of it...<br><br>lala... Oliver... if you disagree with me posting this, feel free to delete it... I can email it to him.<!--ktalk end_comment--></font></td>
