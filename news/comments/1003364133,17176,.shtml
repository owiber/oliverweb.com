<p><b><font face="arial" color="#003399">Transcript of Nancy Talk</font> </b><font face="arial" size="1">Wednesday, October 17, 2001</font><br><font size="2" face="arial">Matt is typing, Oliver is looking at me, Viraj said 'What the hell' Andrew is typing, Chad gots my nose, and Viraj's nose.  So if you're looking for my nose, or Viraj's nose. (*She laughs*) please look for Chad, at, you can contact him at, 55342 (495-5343) or we live in a whole new world, 5397 Olivers 18.  Which habit?  I'll 18 you.  Spiderman says I love you, you see, he says it.  Do you see?  *Makes spiderman sign*  Matt met Chad at the beach.  Eco sucks (*I AGREE*)  Cal sucks, California sucks, yea a long time ago.  Business sucks.  FIG's suck (*I AGREEE*) What?  Figs dont suck, no they do, how do you know?  Oh, ok.  Olivers a moron.  That's why I'm not going to his birthday party for the third time in a row.  He also wont buy me a plane ticket.  That I requested 3 years ago... you're just using that as an excuse, Oliver, Oliver Man, haha, Oliver, yeah Man!  I'm well on my way gaining my freshman 15 (*ha... yeah so now she weighs 20*)  Jester sucks, Kinsolving food sucks.  I shaved Olivers legs (*They're sexy now*)  I'm so random.  Shut up brown boy.  You remind me of this little girl I babysat.  Who would shove any body part away.  Any body part that came near her.  I need to go back to my dorm now, because I'm supposed to meet Jeremy to study, I thought you knew I wasnt coming, that's cause I was sleeping here.  So you just used me for my dining.  You're not paying me back.  I don't want you to pay me back, You cant pay me back... I owe you money anyway, No you can't pay me back cause I owe you money anyway remember?  *SCREAM!!*  Oww... That was Andrews fault.  The end of the world hasnt come yet.  When the end of the world comes it's brown boys fault.  No, but I'll go anywhere with yall this weekend, Minix you havent met Lucky yet, but Oliver met Lucky again.  Do you see why, She even went through two languages and you didnt know either of them, she couldve moved to Tiawanese, Lucky understands Tiawanese, you tell him to (*some word*) he sits.  *Laughs* Thank you Matt for typing.  I'm so spontaneous and random.  Mmmhmm?  You're so cute, you're so cute.  Aww, so sweet.  Know who he's bitten twice?  Yeahhhh, Once cause he decided to shove Doris away from an antpile, he said watch out!  And he like lunged at her.  Are you finished yet?  Can you read what you wrote?  I have to pee so bad, you have no idea.  Ok, that was entirely from my point of view.  What went inside my mouth, what?  what?  What???  What about my mouth?  Wait, what?  Oliver... Yes!  When I talk, mhhmmm  Are you talking about when I talk, oh like that stuff?  I know, yes.  I blibber blabber, nothing intelligent either.  Andrew did it last time, Andrew did it last time!  Andrew did it!  Yeah cause he touched me!  Yeah there you go??  See you did it yourself.  Hahaha, I didn't know your face was there, hey Andrew, what you need is a wake up conversation, Matt will call you and begin a nice conversation early in the morning, and you will get up.  Nooooo! Matt, call me tomorrow at... 7... Conservation, Conversation, Conversation!!  I have to pee, I better go back to dorm, bum around there some more. Huh what you gonna do about that huh?  What you gonna do about that, I use your place to sleep, Oliver doesnt say anything.  I didn't say I hated him, what about all those times I took you somewhere Oliver, what about the time, I went to pick you guys up and you werent even there.  No that doesnt make sense, I went all the way to Motorola and you werent there, you'd gone to Arbies, no not Arby's that other place, Kirby Lane, cause you told me to, Yeah she picked you up but I said...  Yes yall did. You wasted me a trip.  Giffergagger.  Andrew ouch, Andrew obviously you dont understand that story too well.  Are yall hungry?  Hey look.  Hey I got a great idea!  Why dont everybody go watch the movie on friday!  Why not?  On friday?  Why do you have to stay home on friday.  What about saturday?   You know how smell brings back memories?  Chad I think you're just this nice photo album of ex-boyfriends.  Are you still typing what I'm saying, oh crap, this is going to be so retarded, so retarded.  You're mmcap.  OK Matt, you can stop now...  And I really prefer you not to post all that up, cause I dont know what I've said, cause its probably really dumb, Oliver said I dont know the crap I know that comes out of my mouth.  Ok, junk same difference. It's the same as shit.  Can you stop?  Cause I'm about to leave.  Hahahahaha Don't do that my stomach would hurt and I'd pee my pants! No!   aww... hey Matt, the end!  hahaha hahaha, Gimme back my cap!!!!  hello no, i'm normal?  I'm so normal compared to them?  Ok... he said i'm normal!  Give me my PEN CAP!!!  She said I was normal! hahahaha  Can you stop writing now?  Argh!  Hey!  Siming can be me!  I don't hate Oliver!! You ruined it remember??  I killed Andrew so he cant ruin the world.  You ruined it.  SO you know what I really dont care if you ruin the world.  You're gonna hit the limit.  Oh darn.  Chad!  Theres a pen.  Well you have my pen cap.  Wheres my shoes?  I just got a lot of sleep now, so I got a lot of... I am not!!  I'm gonna go study! I'll stab you with this pen, if Chad ever gives it back to me.  Andrew do you realize Oliver is the world?  I dont want to go, I can't My path of moving around is very narrow right now.  So I give up.  Hahaha, hahaha hahaha (*Nancy is laughing hystericalllllly*) Wheres my shoes?  That's what I was... ouch!  You made my shoes disappear didnt you Andrew?  I didn't throw my shoes at you cause I can't find them.  Where are my shoes matt?!  Siming!  I can't find my shoes.

Yay ok friday night!  yes... I know I dont have it!  I didn't promise to anything.  Matt is ssooooooooooooooo cool.  (ok she said stupid...)  Matt is a blue whale, swimming gracefully through the blue ocean underneath the blue sky, feeling very blue.  Azo... Azoolis.  I'll still love Oliver.  Unconditional love.  Which reminds me he needs to get his present.  Yeah.  I better give him before he gets back and something about 8th grade, wahoo  You're so energy draining Chad, maybe you arent ICQ, maybe you dont rub off my ICQ, oh my god... not IQ, I dont know (*mental breakdown*) But you do drain my ATP not my be so... that'd be mgcl.. i'm not a magic person.  OK, I'm gonna hurry my butt home, so I can go pee, you're a butt.  yes you're very very nice.  I wish squirrels would let us pet them, they're so cute.  I wish squirrels would let us pet them.  Absolutely not!  I'm comparing you to an ant, remember?  Ants are adorable.  Ant's do bite.  but that doesn't mean anything.  But you're green.  Yes you are.  And Matts blue.  I found a little baby bumble bee, you shouldnt have tickled me.  Do you know what the speed of light is, 3.00 *10 to the 8th power.  That's c, c is the speed of light.  Well then I dont know what it is i'm learning in chemistry.  Something second silver meters, Chad I can't hold until I get to my dorm, I gotta go pee now!
