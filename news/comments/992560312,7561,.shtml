I guess because many of their songs are guy/girl things. I mean, I know they're supposedly a Christian band. But whenever I see them or read stuff about them (interviews, etc.) they explain their songs and they're about girls and stuff. Of course, they were songs I don't know, not Hanging but a moment. What Olivia wrote verse by verse makes sense.<!--ktalk end_comment--></font></td>
