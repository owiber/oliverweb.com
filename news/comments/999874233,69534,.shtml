<p><b><font face="arial" color="#003399"></font> </b><font face="arial" size="1">Friday, September 7, 2001 <!--(9:50:33)--></font><br><font size="2" face="arial">Well, I'm bored... I actualy just spent the past few minutes writing a rant<br>for this page, but it seemed too pessimistic so I deleted it.  Basically the<br>gist was, I'm bored, this page needs more updates, I can now get through 20<br>comic strip sites in 20 minutes, and I have 3 hours to kill =)  Pretty<br>pointless.  Like this!  Only this is much shorter.  Oliver would've killed me<br>had I posted the other one.  Oliver might kill me for posting this... but I<br>don't believe he is that evil.  Oliver has never struck me as an evil nor<br>diabolical guy.  Now I'm not saying Oliver strikes me as a sweet cute lovable<br>huggable type guy either.  Though I'm sure some people do think that.  I<br>wonder if Oliver would object to me putting a story about him on here... mind<br>you, I have no obsession for Oliver... just... it's his site... and I'm<br>bored.  =)<br><br>Once there was a guy named Oliver, who coincidentally, had the last name<br>Wong.  Oliver liked his name, and took it with him everywhere he went.  He<br>liked his name so much, he started signing it to his papers, and on his<br>checks, and debit slips.  Pretty soon, other people started noticing Olivers<br>name, and started calling him by it.  After that, almost everyone that knew<br>Oliver, knew him by his name.  His name was a big success.  Then Oliver made<br>friends.  But, due to backstabbing and treachery, he soon lost these friends.<br> One such friend was Matthew Minix.  Oliver told Matt that he would help him<br>with a website, that they would both work on.  Now, while Oliver said he<br>would <i>help</i> Matt, he knew full well that he would be doing all the work<br>on it himself.  However, after Matt paid for the site, Oliver did nothing<br>with it!  He just let it sit there... which isn't to say he was totally<br>heartless... he didn't make the site sit on the cold hard floor, but rather<br>gave the site a <a href = "http://www.coconu<br>tcomics.com">chair</a> to sit on, and a little plant for shade, and to<br>produce oxygen if the site so needed.  But this simple act of kindness wasn't<br>enough.  The site felt empty, and Matt, having birthed the site, was saddened<br>by Olivers almost complete surrender of the site to the harshness of the<br>world known as cyberspace.  Pretty soon, all of Olivers other friends began<br>to notice his cruelty.  And they all left him in the gutter to rot and decay.<br> One such person was Van Nguyen.  Van had long suspected Oliver of being an<br>evil fiend of Satan, but being one himself, Van had never cared.  But Van was<br>sympathetic towards websites, being on a dial-up connection, he knew how<br>fragile they were, and he appreciated each byte they entailed.  When he saw<br>the lack of attention Oliver had given CoconutComics.com Van screamed<br>(Editors Note: He screamed like a little girl) he began to sob.  After this,<br>he could no longer look upon Oliver again.  Another friend that abandoned<br>Oliver, was named Chad Wilson.  For a long ti<br>me, Chad respected Oliver, as a person.  But, Chad himself, was a racist. <br>One day before school began, Chad desperately needed a haircut.  He asked<br>Oliver to pay for a haircut which Oliver agreed to do (which btw, still gotta<br>pay you back Oliver!  Don't let me forget!!) After Chad's haircut, his hair<br>was finally, for the first time in perhaps 3 years, above his eyes.  Chad<br>could see!  He looked towards Oliver, and noticed that Oliver was chinese. <br>That was the last time Chad ever spoke to Oliver again.  (Except to borrow<br>more money later)  Even those friends that tried to make a friendship with<br>Oliver work, he soon alienated.  One such person, was Nancy Wong.  Having the<br>same last name as Oliver, everyone always assumed they'd get married.  But,<br>pretty soon, he took something very dear to Nancy.  A toynapping if you will.<br> He did this with the help of Van, who, at the time was still his friend. <br>When Nancy discovered it was Oliver and Van who had taken her toy, she threw<br>herself off of the UT Tower, only to<br> be heard of once again, and that being when she hit the ground and mumbled<br>an "Uh!" <br><br>At this point in his life, Oliver only had a few friends... none of which<br>were close.  Over time, these relationships faded as well.  One friend, a guy<br>named Brook, who ironically enough, had an aversion to saying the name<br>Matt... tried with all of his heart to keep his relationship with Oliver...<br>but it was not to be.  One day, Brook's car broke down.  The truth came out. <br>Oliver was only friends with Brook for his explorer.  Another friend, Mark,<br>stopped being friends with Oliver, after Olivers 427th attempt to get him to<br>say "Polo" <br><br>At this point, Oliver became a recluce.  Locking himself in his room, staring<br>at the one thing that kept him whole.  A poster of Josh Hartnett.  He would<br>every night, pray to the poster.  Praying that the great Josh would come, and<br>save him from his demise.  But the posters ears were closed.  A month after<br>locking himself in his room, his two sisters, Olivia, and Oriana planned a<br>trap for him.  Oriana hid behind a crate, while Olivia snuck behind him. <br>Olivia AWP'ed her brother, at a range of 800 pixels.<br><br>And so ended, the tragic life, of someones whose name, is now better left<br>forgotten.<br><b>-<a href="mailto:minix1f@aol.com">Minix</a></b></font><br>
