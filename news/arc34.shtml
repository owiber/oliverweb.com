What's up? I'm at work right now and I'm bored. I'm going to write you a story, k? Ok. Here goes. Once, there was this rabbit and it hopped all around and around, until one day it could hop no more.  What happened? I don't have the slightest idea. Then a worm came and poked the rabbit's foot.  The worm hopped away. Then a bear came and ate the rabbit, but the rabbit wasn't digested, it just teleported out of the bear's stomach. The bear got really confused as to why he was hungry again so fast so he bit his hand, but he didn't eat it because that would be bad. Then one day, the sun rose and the moon set. ThEnd.</blockquote>Cool huh, did you like that Dia...Journal? Good night. ZZzzzzzz... !!!!! Oh! I'm at work, I can't do that...<br><b>-<a href="mailto:oliver@oliverweb.com">Oliver</a></b></font><br>

Symantec CEO John                     Thompson called it a "regrettable but understandable"                     mistake.</blockquote></i>Hehe... and since I have a couple of blondes visiting this site... no, this news is not real.
