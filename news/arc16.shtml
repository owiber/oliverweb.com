Hope you're interested in doing yours still =)<br><br>and 4) How do the URL's look to everyone?  Wes do you want yours changed or are those ok?  Oliver do you want MrTechHappy to have its own domain or link to www.mrtechhappy.com?  and Brook, if willing to have comic on CC do you want it to stay on Geocities page, or do you want a directory on CC's?<br><br>lastly, if you want an email address at coconutcomics to forward to you, let me know what address you want, and what address you want it to forward to.<br><br>ie: <i> Wes@coconutcomics.com forwards to wretchedkat@whatever.com </i><br><b>-<a href="mailto:minix1f@aol.com">Minix</a></b></font><br>

During the intervening time, the Mind of Minix had deliberately sought to deceive OliverWEB by false statements and expressions of kindness and humor.<br><br>The attack yesterday on OliverWEB causes sever ugliness and l4m3n3ss to OliverWEB layout and design. Very many effects were lost. In addition, other images on OliverWEB and FTP password have been reported as being lost and/or destroyed.<br><br>Yesterday, Minix was also declared l4m3.<br><br>Last night, Minix slept happily despite his evil doings.<br><br>Minix Empire has, therefore, undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout OliverWEB and it's many pages. The facts of yesterday speak for themselves.<br><br>As Ruler of OliverWEB, I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense.<br><br>I now declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by Minix on Monday, 24 September, a state of war has existed between OliverWEB and Minix Empire.<br><br>Now...
