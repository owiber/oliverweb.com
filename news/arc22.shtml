I think I made this one, I know I made one like it if not this one, theres a lot of them out there)<br><br>But obviously, since I made it a long time ago, it was not done with Olivia in mind, it looks *sorta* like her, but not really, I cant picture her in this outfit... but... well, it's better then the one I worked on today and last night, and its the closest I ever did =)  <br><b>-<a href="mailto:minix1f@aol.com">Minix</a></b></font><br>

<p><b><font face="arial" color="#003399">Lala =) Remember sheep?</font> </b><font face="arial" size="1">Saturday, July 21, 2001</font><br><font size="2" face="arial">Do you all remember the old <a href = "http://www.oliverweb.com/boredom2/sheep/index.html">sheep</a> program that was featured on Oliverweb?  It was awhile ago... well I was looking at that program the other day, and I started thinking "You know what?  I could probably do something like that" I mentioned this to Olivia, and decided she should be the character walking around the desktop.  I started to work on it.  Lala, here is some preliminary (and sucky =)) art of Olivia walking =)  <br><center><br><img src="http://www.oliverweb.com/newsimages/lalabad.gif"><br></center><br><br>Seems to be walking really quickly huh?  Well thats because the shareware anim-gif creator I downloaded, had no delay option... and I was too lazy to go find another one, in the program, I'll be able to slow it down very easily, and it will look tons better =)<br><br>I just want to say something to Oliver now =)  <br><br><center><i>bite me =)</i></center><br><br>If anyones curious, thats my response to him, before he gives me another <a href = "http://www.oliverweb.com/chats/om6.shtml">"melody minix"</a> comment =)<br><br>I'm trying to think of some things for her to do, like the sheep would whimper, eat flowers, etc.  Please give suggestions =)  Also, I'm trying to decide if I should make her, fall towards the bottom of the screen, like a gravity thing, or if I should allow her to walk around the desktop, as if it were a flat surface, please, give me feedback!<br><b>-<a href="mailto:minix1f@aol.com">Minix</a></b></font><br>

I'm thinking about switching over to it from "WabbaMan"... what you think?
