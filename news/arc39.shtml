Make sure you check them all out ;) Have fun!<p>Oh, and there will be tons of inside jokes on this site... so if something seems weird, strange, or whatever (like the "Anon is funny" part in the <a href="../index.shtml">intro</a>) it's probably an inside joke. =)<br><b>-<a href="mailto:oliver@oliverweb.com">Oliver</a></b></font><br>
