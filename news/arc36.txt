Such milestones as the 1000th or 1000000th visit is a big deal to a lot of sites and many give away stuff to the lucky visitor. I think I deserve a prize too.<p><center><img src=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/acc.gif height=100 width=290 border=0></center><p>It's not often when you beat the <i>first</i>(!) visitor to a site. The amazing thing is that even when I refreshed, I was still the 0th visitor! There must be some kind of disturbance in the force or something...<br><b>-<a href="mailto:oliver@oliverweb.com">Oliver</a></b></font><br>

I thought it was just that it was cheap. It's actually because I never calibrated it. Doh. Doh. Doh! Anyways, the calibrated scanner scanned four of the new pics (the ones on page <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/23/index.shtml>23</a>). I've added three pages for now, pages <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/21/index.shtml>21</a> to 23. Enjoy! =) And yes, there will be more later when I get the pictures from Amanda's camera and your cameras...<br><b>-<a href="mailto:oliver@oliverweb.com">Oliver</a></b></font><br>
