<p><b><font face="arial" color="#003399">NWN Domination</font> </b><font face="arial" size="1">Wednesday, July 10, 2002</font><br><font size="2" face="arial">Well, I beat it. Here's a few of my comments on the last chapter...<br><br>I'm a bit disappointed by how easy it was... I think that perhaps I became TOO powerful of a wizard cause my battle with two giant dragons lasted a mere 30 seconds tops (they couldn't withstand many 120+ point chain lightnings =)... and after I figured out how to beat the last boss, that fight took even less time...<br><br>The fight with the two dragons was in a cave with LOTS of open space... I think that was supposed to be used to run around to avoid the dragons... but ummm... I barely moved at all... I wish they would have adjusted the dragon's strengths/weaknesses to offer the most challenge to a certain player-type... I'm sure people who require melee combat would have a much harder time, but since I can do massive amounts of damage from afar... it was quite an easy task.<br><br>The ending is pretty anti-climatic I think and I would have liked them to have put some time into a CG rendered FMV scene at the end to reward the player for HOURS of play-time but alas... they didn't.<br><br>So... I'm done with a majority of my NWN fun, although I plan on playing through at least a little bit of the single player again to refine my character a little bit more (primarily to bring him over to Good, rather than Neutral)...<br><br>And Brook, I have found a way to defeat your super spell-resitance! ;)<br><br>And Sean, I don't care what you think. I don't care if you (and others =) have no clue what I'm talking about. I can say anything I want here. ;)<br><b>-<a href="mailto:oliver@oliverweb.com">Oliver</a></b></font><br>

You all should go check out <a href = "http://www.earthviewer.com">EarthViewer</a> as it is a very neat program =)  you have to download it, but... you can get satellite images of a whole lot of places... updated frequently,  what makes it really neat though is, type in an address, and it finds it incredibly quick, and as far as I can tell, goes within 300 or so yards... (the few I tried were that close, i'm guessing less populated areas aren't going to be so accurate, but who knows?)  I was able to recognize a tree in my backyard os yeah, pretty neat =)  only a 14 day trial though, ahwell,  anyway yeah, try =) <br><b>-<a href="mailto:minix@mail.utexas.edu">Minix</a></b></font><br>
