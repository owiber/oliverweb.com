Story Time!!!``xMinix``xOnce upon a time, there lived a boy.  This boy really badly wanted to be a fisherman when he grew up.  He dreamt about it every night.  While he was awake, he would imagine plans for getting to such a high post.  One day, he told his father that he wanted to be a fisherman.<br><br>"Daddy!  I want to be a fisherman!"<br><br>His father groaned, and after a long pause, responded.  "Son... You know how I've always told you you could be anything you wanted to be, if you set your mind to it?"<br><br>"Oh yes daddy!"<br><br>"Well I lied... the truth is the world is a huge trap.  You grow up, you dream, your dreams get stuffed into your throat, and you're placed somewhere with just enough money to survive, and you're forced to stay there, because if you leave, you starve."<br><br>"No no daddy!  That's not true!" Shouted the little boy.  "I will be the exception!"<br><br>And the boy tried to be the exception, he did everything he could... but unfourtanetly, he didn't realize, that everyone else was also trying to be the exception... they all got trapped, including the ambitious little boy, and everyone went about their lives with their heads held low, pretending to be happy, but inside, knowing that they were nothing and unimportant.``xEppEppAEypccIZCEXi``x1001016360``x(default)

For: Oliver =) (Though everyone should read it...)``xMinix``xWell, I'm bored... I actually just spent the past few minutes writing a rant for this page, but it seemed too pessimistic so I deleted it. Basically the gist was, I'm bored, this page needs more updates, I can now get through 20 comic strip sites in 20 minutes, and I have 3 hours to kill =) Pretty pointless. Like this! Only this is much shorter. Oliver would've killed me had I posted the other one. Oliver might kill me for posting this... but I don't believe he is that evil. Oliver has never struck me as an evil nor diabolical guy. Now I'm not saying Oliver strikes me as a sweet cute lovable huggable type guy either. Though I'm sure some people do think that. I wonder if Oliver would object to me putting a story about him on here... mind you, I have no obsession for Oliver... just... it's his site... and I'm bored. =)<br><br>Once there was a guy named Oliver, who coincidentally, had the last name Wong. Oliver liked his name, and took it with him everywhere he went. He liked his name so much, he started signing it to his papers, and on his checks, and debit slips. Pretty soon, other people started noticing Olivers name, and started calling him by it. After that, almost everyone that knew Oliver, knew him by his name. His name was a big success. Then Oliver made friends. But, due to backstabbing and treachery, he soon lost these friends. One such friend was Matthew Minix. Oliver told Matt that he would help him with a website, that they would both work on. Now, while Oliver said he would <i>help</i> Matt, he knew full well that he would be doing all the work on it himself. However, after Matt paid for the site, Oliver did nothing with it! He just let it sit there... which isn't to say he was totally heartless... he didn't make the site sit on the cold hard floor, but rather gave the site a <a href = "http://www.coconutcomics.com">chair</a> to sit on, and a little plant for shade, and to produce oxygen if the site so needed. But this simple act of kindness wasn't enough. The site felt empty, and Matt, having birthed the site, was saddened by Olivers almost complete surrender of the site to the harshness of the world known as cyberspace. Pretty soon, all of Olivers other friends began to notice his cruelty. And they all left him in the gutter to rot and decay. One such person was Van Nguyen. Van had long suspected Oliver of being an evil fiend of Satan, but being one himself, Van had never cared. But Van was sympathetic towards websites, being on a dial-up connection, he knew how fragile they were, and he appreciated each byte they entailed. When he saw the lack of attention Oliver had given CoconutComics.com Van screamed (Editors Note: He screamed like a little girl) he began to sob. After this, he could no longer look upon Oliver again. Another friend that abandoned Oliver, was named Chad Wilson. For a long time, Chad respected Oliver, as a person. But, Chad himself, was a racist.  One day before school began, Chad desperately needed a haircut. He asked Oliver to pay for a haircut which Oliver agreed to do (which btw, still gotta pay you back Oliver! Don't let me forget!!) After Chad's haircut, his hair was finally, for the first time in perhaps 3 years, above his eyes. Chad could see! He looked towards Oliver, and noticed that Oliver was chinese.  That was the last time Chad ever spoke to Oliver. (Except to borrow more money later) Even those friends that tried to make a friendship with Oliver work, he soon alienated. One such person, was Nancy Wong. Having the same last name as Oliver, everyone always assumed they'd get married. But, pretty soon, he took something very dear to Nancy. A toynapping if you will. He did this with the help of Van, who, at the time was still his friend. When Nancy discovered it was Oliver and Van who had taken her toy, she threw herself off of the UT Tower, only to be heard of once again, and that being when she hit the ground and mumbled an "Uh!" <br><br>At this point in his life, Oliver only had a few friends... none of which were close. Over time, these relationships faded as well. One friend, a guy named Brook, who ironically enough, had an aversion to saying the name Matt... tried with all of his heart to keep his relationship with Oliver... but it was not to be. One day, Brook's car broke down. The truth came out.  Oliver was only friends with Brook for his explorer. Another friend, Mark, stopped being friends with Oliver, after Olivers 427th attempt to get him to say "Polo" <br><br>At this point, Oliver became a recluce. Locking himself in his room, staring at the one thing that kept him whole. A poster of Josh Hartnett. He would every night, pray to the poster. Praying that the great Josh would come, and save him from his demise. But the posters ears were closed. A month after locking himself in his room, his two sisters, Olivia, and Oriana planned a trap for him. Oriana hid behind a crate, while Olivia snuck behind him. Olivia AWP'ed her brother, at a range of 800 pixels. <br><br>And so ended, the tragic life, of someones whose name, is now better left forgotten.<br>``xAAAlZuFlZHdIlctoa``x999881587``x(default)

A bleak day in posting``xMinix``x<i>She left me... She said it was best for both of us, that we were still young and we should see other people, explore new worlds, experience life and grow as individuals... She said she loved me, that she'll always love me no matter what. And maybe, just maybe, if we were meant to be, we'll find our way back to each other again... I just stood there, bawling. Then it was time for recess, so I steeled myself and went out to play kickball. The guys needed me. Even though I'd just been dumped, I couldn't let them down. I was usually the last one picked, but still a vital contributor off the bench. <br>Ah, third grade...

Funny Story``xOlivia``xHilo ^.^ I thought this was pretty funny.. I found it a little bit ago.. it's a story I wrote in 6th grade (I never finished it, thank goodness).. it's not that long (TG.. ;))... but it's really funny because... can anybody imagine Oliver or me like this? =D<br>***<br><br>In a far away galaxy, lived a young, beautiful princess. Her name was Oriana Wong. Her mother and father, the Queen and King, lived in the palace with her and ruled the country. Oriana wasn't alone though, true, she is the youngest of her family, but she had an older brother and sister named, Prince Oliver and the #1 princess Olivia. Here is the story of their lives.<br><br><i>For more, go to Comments ^.^</i><br>``xAAVlVlpEkEpxsRerD``x995865212``x(default)
New And Improved``xMinix``xDon't get me wrong, I sorta liked the other animated gif of Olivia... despite it looking nothing like her, but... gotta make it better =)  this is the better one =) <br><center><br>(heh... accidentally overwrote it, will fix when I get home)<br></center><br>Not that bad... if you've known me long, (4 years)  you know I used to waste my life making stuff like this, this one is one of those I made back then (I think... heh, I made a lot... I think I made this one, I know I made one like it if not this one, theres a lot of them out there)<br><br>But obviously, since I made it a long time ago, it was not done with Olivia in mind, it looks *sorta* like her, but not really, I cant picture her in this outfit... but... well, it's better then the one I worked on today and last night, and its the closest I ever did =)  ``xAAVZZAAEZEXKjYljc``x995787117``x(default)
Lala =) Remember sheep?``xMinix``xDo you all remember the old <a href = "http://www.oliverweb.com/boredom2/sheep/index.html">sheep</a> program that was featured on Oliverweb?  It was awhile ago... well I was looking at that program the other day, and I started thinking "You know what?  I could probably do something like that" I mentioned this to Olivia, and decided she should be the character walking around the desktop.  I started to work on it.  Lala, here is some preliminary (and sucky =)) art of Olivia walking =)  <br><center><br><img src="http://www.oliverweb.com/newsimages/lalabad.gif"><br></center><br><br>Seems to be walking really quickly huh?  Well thats because the shareware anim-gif creator I downloaded, had no delay option... and I was too lazy to go find another one, in the program, I'll be able to slow it down very easily, and it will look tons better =)<br><br>I just want to say something to Oliver now =)  <br><br><center><i>bite me =)</i></center><br><br>If anyones curious, thats my response to him, before he gives me another <a href = "http://www.oliverweb.com/chats/om6.shtml">"melody minix"</a> comment =)<br><br>I'm trying to think of some things for her to do, like the sheep would whimper, eat flowers, etc.  Please give suggestions =)  Also, I'm trying to decide if I should make her, fall towards the bottom of the screen, like a gravity thing, or if I should allow her to walk around the desktop, as if it were a flat surface, please, give me feedback!``xAAVZukEEuEkKWnFPW``x995749314``x(default)

Ochs``xOliver``xBravo man... really, I "applaud" you. You've been successful in deleting a few quotes and memories from OliverWEB. Great job, really. I don't know if I could have done it better myself.<br><br>I could just email this to you, but I know you'll read it here. I've got nothing to hide, perhaps you do? I could very well go through every strand of OliverWEB and take off every reference of you... how would you like that? I won't... I'll be the bigger man right now. I won't lower myself to your level. Getting pissed yet? You have a problem with that. Read on. Perhaps you should think through things a bit more before you actually do things. That's a novel idea, <i>think</i>. Wow. <br><br>You need help man, I'm sorry... I don't think I can anymore. Perhaps you've forgotten all the times I've tried. After all this, do you still not see clearly, are you still all tangled up in your pride? Wow, you're 18 now... that makes you a man, right? Yeah, just like how wearing that black belt makes you a super cool martial arts dude. Let me tell you something. And make sure you listen and understand, because you've probably had some trouble thinking lately. It means <i>nothing</i>. Nothing at all. Think you're a man? Can handle your own life? Deep within, you're not a man, you're a whining little brat foul mouthing every person around him because things didn't go your way.<br><br>Stop trying to control people... you can't, you won't, and you'll only end up screwing your own life up while hurting others in the process. Am I pissed right now? Yes. Another congratulations to you man, you got Oliver mad. Few have been able to achieve that task. That make you the best? The smartest dude ever? Give me a break. You didn't even "hack" into OliverWEB. You *knew* my quote page password... that's smart thinking there, let me tell you. You broke a trust, have I ever broken a trust to hurt you?<br><br>Perhaps you weren't the one who messed with the page? Let's look into this, shall we? You knew my password. It was a few days/hours (I don't know, I was in Dallas) after I erased your account(s) on OliverWEB, so you have a motive. "To each his own..." has you written all over it. Perhaps it wasn't you? No, scratch that idea. <br><br>I urge you to look within yourself and see how truly twisted you are right now. There's a song that goes "humble thyself in the sight of the Lord"... maybe you've sung it before? You should listen to the words from your own mouth. Really, you should. I said I was mad, but do I hate you? No, I will never hate you no matter what you do. I am sorry for you, I'm sorry our friendship has gotten to become like this, I'm sorry there <i>is no friendship</i> anymore.<br><br>May God be with you and open your eyes. You'll need Him.<br><br>-To the others reading this, please don't add any "scolding" in the comments. Let this be.``xAAupupZupIEIeuIEL``x994047940``x(default)

An interesting tidbit``xMinix``xLala, and now, something from the Bible... (sorry for the language... other bible in car... and this ones kind of old)<br><br>OK, oldest guy in the bible... was Methuselah who lived to 969 years old... how do you think he died?  I would guess... Old age... but...<br><br>Genesis 5:26  "And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred and sixty and nine years: and he died"<br><br>his son, Lemach was born when Methuselah was 187<br><br>Genesis 5:25 "And Methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech"<br><br>and then, Lemach had a son, Noah<br><br>Genesis 5:28-29 "And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son, (29) and he called his name Noah.<br><br>Genesis 7:6 "And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth"<br><br>lala... 187+182+600 = 969... which means that Methuselah either died the year of the flood, or in the flood... <br><br>Pretty cool I thought =)<br>``xAAFyEZFVZfhuXJEpi``x993624557``x(default)

" -Sarah</i></blockquote><br>Well, those are a few that stood out for now... I'd just like to note that a lot of Minix's quotes seem like random words just thrown in there and make no sense at all. =) Speaking of quotes, I think I'm goin to redo the whole random quote generator thing up there... hasn't had a revamp in a year or so. =)``xAAFulyppFzISNQBFp``x993493203``x(default)

A question...``xMinix``xAlright, at District this weekend, there were two girls competing in HI and DI... (Humourous Interp and Dramatic Interp)  the definition for how judges should rate contestants, is based on their voice inflections in conveying the message of the piece... the two girls are deaf, and can't speak... <br><br>NFL stated that they couldn't compete, because of the rules... so they sued the NFL, and had a federal court hearing on it...<br><br>Because of this, HI and DI are now postponded for almost a month... <br><br>what are your opinions on this?<br><br>personally, my feelings are, that while I'm impressed that they want to compete, and I wont deny the importance of humourus and dramatic acting for deaf people... I don't think they should be competing at a speech tournament... I'm going to quote Brian... "You don't see people in wheelchairs suing to play football."  <br><br>Maybe I'm just being a jerk... but the fact is, judges can't understand their pieces, but certainly wont give them last out of pity... <br><br>Please share...``xAllulZlukWpoclwbw``x988495042``x(default)

Matt's Time To Vent!``xMinix``xI hope this doesn't annoy anyone, but no one is online, and I need to complain. =)<br><br>First... I hate stereotypes... I hate how some people will label an entire group based on one person.  For example someone saying that all christians hate gays, and have no fun... I like to think I have fun, and I have never hated anyone... I dislike people who say that all "blacks/crackers/etc are stupid."  or any other generalization like that... it just annoys me...<br><br>Second... I hate how people create these stereotypes... how there are some people who claim to be christians and then go out and kill people who are gay to "prove" it.  Or how people who are christians insist that other christians only listen to christian music, because all other music is from the devil...  UGH!  heh... ok, I think I'm done...<br><br>Thank you for listening to me rant...``xAlZZkuFylrOWWHxzW``x987731568``x(default)

Kickin' it in the hizouse on the west saiyeed``xWes``x^that's eubonics...or however you spell that...or should I say <i>spizznell</i>?  Hardy har har.  Anyway....I decided that since i haven't put in any kind of news in a while, that I should.  So that's what's going on.  Having fun yet?  I thought so.  Well, I suppose I'll tell you what's going on in Wes's Life.<br><br>Last night, two of my friends and I went to downtown Fort Worth in my redneck rig(my truck).  Sitting in the back were a bunch of instruments and my friend Josh...just to make sure nothing flew out or got jacked while we sat at a red light.  We drove around forever, trying to find a corner where we could park and unload and stuff, but we couldn't...then we pulled up to this stoplight, and my friend Cliff hopped out and grabbed a guitar and ran to a corner.  Then the other guy, Josh, and I drove around for eternity trying to find somewhere close by to park.  Finally, we parked at another red light right by the corner Cliff had claimed, and they unloaded the truck with blinding speed that would shame superman!  Then I went to a parking garage and proceeded up, then foolishly drove in the same circle for about five minutes before realizing that I had seen one car in particular about three times already...I felt positively stupid.  Well, I finally parked and grabbed the bass guitar that was in there, and went to the corner, recieving a Christian track thingy on the way that said "Are You a Survivor?" like the show...  Well anyway I got to the corner, and we set up and started by playing "Friends in Low Places," and a couple more, and then....a cop came and told us to quiet down.  Someone in the apartmets across the street had complained.  Darn.  So we went acoustics, but the drummer couldn't hear me, so I hooked up to the little amp, and we played quite quietly, gaining about four bucks because we so good, and then....lo and behold here came the cop.  Darn.  So they began packing up, and I walked to the parking garage a few blocks away, then right as I had gotten up three flights of stairs, then walked one level up, I checked my pockets, and.....<B>NO KEYS!!!  WHERE ARE MY KEYYYS!?!?!  I JUST WALKED FOR TEN MINUTES TO GET HERE AND I HAVE NO KEYS!!!!</B> <i>Okay....calm....deep breaths...let's just calm down...there must be some way out of this nasty situation....  </I> Then, I remembered something.  I reached deep into my pockets, and I fished around a bit, pulled out my wallet, and opened it, only to discover.....*triumphant music*  KEYS!!! I always keep a spare set of keys in my wallet for events JUST LIKE THIS!!! YYAYAYAAAAAAAAYYYY!!!  Well, the rest is really quite inconsequential.  I went to the corner, we packed up, drove around for a parking space, for the garage thing was absolutely out of the question, then we went into a lot, right as someone was leaving, and spent a looong time trying to pack a big amplifier, a bass drum, three toms, two snares, four cymbals, a small amp, a head, and three guitars into the cab of my truck so they wouldn't be stolen by the evil folk of downtown.  Good thing too, because it started raining later...Well, when it began raining, we ran into this place called the Coffee Haus, where I got a root beer, Josh got a Dr. Pepper, and Cliff got their strongest coffee drink:  Rocket Fuel, into which he placed about 8 chocolate-covered espresso beans, and about 12 packets of sugar(and it was so strong that even after all that sugar, it was still incredibly bitter and coffee-tasting).  He did not sleep that night.  Well, we played some chess, and then the nice employees to which we are eternally grateful granted us some trash bags to cover our equipment with when we moved it to the back of my truck.  All in all, I'd say it was a pretty good night, which I enjoyed quite a bit.  I will do this again next friday, but this time, we'll get a permit to play guitar and drums and All Manner of Things on the street corner.  <br><br><br>Sorry that this is so long...I don't have anywhere else to put it...however, as an apology, here is a sandwich!!!<br><center><img src="http://hometown.aol.com/holyyam/images/eat the sammich.jpg"></center>``xAlZkAuEpAMFZKTkqx``x987301309``x(default)

Wednesday``xOliver``xYep, another episode of OliverWEB's Spring Break mini-series!<blockquote><img src=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/newyork.gif width=128 height=128 alt="New York" align=left>HellHare decided he didn't really care about the chicken, <i>"Bwah, voo carez avout da ziken anaywayz... Isa vilz hup ta Niw Yerk Cita!!"</i> So off HellHare went, to the Big Apple...<br><br>There, HellHare had to sneak past customs... he decided to disguise himself as a stuffed animal. It worked, except customs thought he was so ugly, they chunked him in a trash can. <i>"Oh velz, ut lezt Ima inz da U-esa-A..."</i> HellHare then found the local 7-11 and stole a map. Unfortunately, maps don't have the location of nuclear silos on them. <i>"Dohz, tupeed mupz"</i> muttered HellHare.<br><br>So off HellHare went <i>again</i> to find the silos the hard way...</blockquote><br><br>WILL HELLHARE EVER FIND THE NUCLEAR SILOS?!<br><br>WHAT REALLY DID HAPPEN TO THE CHICKEN!?<br><br>THESE ANSWERS AND MORE, NEXT TIME!``xAluVAllEyRkzLWMIY``x984606016``x(default)

We Be Geeks!``xMinix``xOliver and I have been having a theoretical discussion on the quote page now for a little while, and so far no one but us has contributed.  Admittedly, it's kind of far down the page, and no one really looks down there, but underneath Wes's quote, about hoping all the guys on AIM would stop talking to her whatever, we've had this conversation<br><br><br><blockquote><i><br>Christine:  lol, point taken, Wes =P but... still Olivia's quote was an original one that you "copyrighted"... i mean plagarized? no wait never mind =P<br><br>Minix:  It would be plagiarized, but in reality, I think its Olivia that plagirized it from Wes... she got a time machine... *prepares for the philosiphical conversation thats bound to come*<br><br>Oliver: Woah... it would probably be theoretical not "philosiphical", Matt. =) But I'll spare you all this time... =) <br><br>Minix: Theoretical, whatever =) Well I'll do it instead. If she went to the future to copy the quote that Wes did, after getting the idea from Olivia, it would create sort of an infinite loop... or no quotes would show up in the first place, which creates a new dilemma... how many times in our lives, do we go into the future in a time machine, in hopes of finding something to copy, but we don't actually do anything because theres nothing to copy, because people that we were going to copy were copying what we were going to copy? Huh? huh? Interesting thought huh? =)<br><br>Oliver: Here's my theory... there's a relatively popular theory that if a time machine was ever created, it could never go back in time before it was actually invented... assuming that is true, I think that once a time machine is invented, that VERY VERY chaotic things will start happening and the Earth will soon have a TON of people on the planet from different time periods in the future, all of whom are traveling farthest in the past that is possible. Which may lead to the demise of mankind because the Earth cannot sustain that many humans... but then.. if all those people die or the relatives of those people die, how would they get there in the first place?... oohhh... ahh... Oh, and I think that according to that theory, that once the last screw (or whatever =) is attached to the time machine, that the inventor will know it worked because instantly at that point, people or at least one person will "teleport" into that room/area from a different time period. Cool, huh? =) <br><br>Minix: What if they went back into time, and killed the proffessor, and blew up the time machine?<br><br>Oliver: Then a vortex will appear and suck up all of existance into it. God would turn to Jesus and say "did we really make them in our image? they're not too bright... what is this, the 50 billionth time we had to do this?" Jesus will say "yeah, but they're cute little things running all over the place. Gotta love em." So they'll reset time and make one of the screws in the time machine malfunction so it never worked... =)<br><br>Minix: Ah... I see... so you're saying a time machine would be impossible to make?<br><br>Oliver: Lol, maybe... I really don't know. =) although there's some theoretical stuff that says even if you went back in time, there would be some kind of thing stopping you from changing it... I dunno, I saw it on TLC or the Discovery channel once =)<br><br>Minix: hmm... could you touch stuff, it just wouldn't effect anything?  <br></blockquote></i><br><br><br><br>and that's where we're at now.  We need help!  Someone else contribute!<br><br>``xAZAyppFulWjRFkEtM``x979607548``x(default)

Olivers rating, with time, eventually went down to a 7... still beating me by .1, but he no longer has the highest rating... Olivia's picture holds that one so far with a 7.3(?).   But fear not!  This picture rating sham is not yet over!  As there will still be pictures to rate!  =)  hehe, if you want one put up there, let me know!  I know some people deathly dont want me to either, if you dont, let me know too... just in case I forget =)<br><br>BTW... on Olivers rating... statistically speaking, there is a margin of error... I figure it to be about 70% (ha!  that math is wrong)  with a group of only 300 and not even random!  so i figure he deserved a zero... but thats just my opinion =)  sorry Oliver =)  ook!  tata!``xAZlVZyupkuHjdWzKR``x978583602``x(default)

Admittance``xChad``xI thouroghly enjoy admitting that I should be prepared to take a Government exam, but quite unfortunately, am not.  Perhaps, through the possibilities of statistics (I can randomly guess, yet still get an "A"), it won't be all too terrible.  I very much encourage you all to encourage me as I strive to overcome this frightfully intimidating ordeal.  Despite the fact that should you encourage me I will not receive it until after I have taken the exam, your encouragement is ultimately extremely important to me.

Comment on this, Blockheads!``xChad``xOnce upon a time, there was a poor young soul who inadvertently named himself "Blockhead." This resulted in many people calling him "Blockhead," for they believed in calling a person by their name. <br><script language="JavaScript">var bla=new String(window.location); if (bla.search("main") != -1){ document.write("<br><a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/chad>Click here</a> to read the rest!<"); document.write("!--"); }</script>Blockhead did not thoroughly enjoy being labeled "Blockhead," whereas this would have a mildly offensive effect on any person who was called such. So, Blockhead was on a mission. It was of utmost importance that his name transformed into something other than "Blockhead." How he was going to bring about this transformation, he had no idea, because the first time he named himself, it was an accident, much like when you crash into a parked car going 10000 mph with no intention of doing so. Blockhead starts with the basics: he calls his local city hall and asks the secretary how he should go about changing his name. Upon partially listening to Blockhead's question, the secretary claims that a person should be proud of the name he or she so fatefully owns, and never go about changing it. Blockhead decides that people related to areas of politics should not let personal influences guide them in their work, and then he moves on to his second plan: surreptitiously changing his name and leaving all other parties unaware of the change. <i>By leaving them out in my name change, surely they will see how I despise them for calling me "Blockhead"</i>, thought Blockhead. Unfortunately, Blockhead did not think this strategy all the way through, for everybody was not taken aback at his exclusive actions, and nor did they cease to poke fun at him. It is about this time that Blockhead meets Boobface, and decides his name isn't so bad after all. From that point forward, he survives a confident life until he dies.<br><br><center>The End</center><br><script language="JavaScript">if (bla.search("main") == -1){ document.write("<"); document.write("!--"); }</script>-->``xAZVAZVyEFVnKFumnM``x975982813``xChadStuff

"Is that really Pat Buchanan?" he asked. <br>"I don't think so" I replied. <br>He went back to his office.  I don't think I'll see him near my desk for the rest of the day.  For that alone I owe you guys a big thanks<br> <br>Greetings to Austin from my dark corner cubicle in New York<br><br>Fred</i></blockquote><br><br><br>If you're confused, we recorded a track called Buchanans Concession Speech about the elections... it was me talking, not Buchanan.

Dear Diary``xOliver``xDear Diary,<blockquote>I mean Journal, sorry.  What's up? I'm at work right now and I'm bored. I'm going to write you a story, k? Ok. Here goes. Once, there was this rabbit and it hopped all around and around, until one day it could hop no more.  What happened? I don't have the slightest idea. Then a worm came and poked the rabbit's foot.  The worm hopped away. Then a bear came and ate the rabbit, but the rabbit wasn't digested, it just teleported out of the bear's stomach. The bear got really confused as to why he was hungry again so fast so he bit his hand, but he didn't eat it because that would be bad. Then one day, the sun rose and the moon set.

Here's a funny little nerd "news-brief":<blockquote><i>Cupertino, Cal. (SatireWire.com) - Symantec issued an                     apology to Microsoft yesterday after the security                     software maker's AntiVirus Research Center issued an                     alert for a "widespread and lethal virus known to cause                     system crashes and data loss" that turned out to be the                     Windows 2000 operating system. Symantec CEO John                     Thompson called it a "regrettable but understandable"                     mistake.</blockquote></i>Hehe... and since I have a couple of blondes visiting this site... no, this news is not real.  It is <i>fake</i>. =) Check out <a href=http://www.satirewire.com target="_blank">SatireWire</a> for more news, most of it is for the 'tech-people'... for other kinds of satirical news, go to <a href=http://www.bbspot.com target="_blank">BBSpot</a>.``xAykVAAElVatlyIqqD``x962606385``x(default)

Time for my more links!``xOliver``xWell, been keeping up to date with the news in our world at work and game up with these. <blockquote><i>Los Angeles, CA - Teen pop sensation Britney Spears whose hits "Oops I Did It Again" and "Baby, One More Time" is recovering today in a Los Angeles hospital after her breasts exploded while filming her latest video.   Three other people were treated for minor injuries.</blockquote></i>Hmmm... yeah... read the <a href=http://bbspot.com/News/2000/5/britney_oops.html target="_blank">rest</a>.  <br>It also seems like that Microsoft trial has made an unexpected turn...<blockquote><i>Redmond, WA - Microsoft today filed papers in Federal District Court alleging that the United States Government is a monopoly.  The papers allege that the current government has stifled competition, and has prevented innovation in government, by using its monopoly power to pass laws prohibiting the formation of another Federal government.</blockquote></i>Uh... that was very surprising, eh?

ACC Counter``xOliver``xWell, in my many days of being a webmaster and staff for large sites, I've seen many prizes given to the special person to be the something'th visitor to a site. Such milestones as the 1000th or 1000000th visit is a big deal to a lot of sites and many give away stuff to the lucky visitor. I think I deserve a prize too.<p><center><img src=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/acc.gif height=100 width=290 border=0></center><p>It's not often when you beat the <i>first</i>(!) visitor to a site.

Articles!``xOliver``xI've added the <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/articles/index.shtml>Articles</a> section to OliverWEB. I'll be putting stuff like the <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/articles/hoodlums.shtml>Hoodlums!</a> story on that page. I've already added one more story. <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/articles/index.shtml>Go over there</a> and check it out! =)``xAupAAZuAVRcFgYKXy``x941004695``x(default)
More and more!``xOliver``xYes, I've added even MORE stuff to OliverWEB. =) I've added a few more quotes to the random generator's list of quotes (which can be seen <a href=random.txt>here</a>) and added another pics section, making page <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/8/index.shtml>eight</a>! I've linked to the <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/boredom2/quotes/index.shtml>Quotes</a> page from the sidebar (the '-' means that the link is a subsection of the section above it) and added the <a href=../stuff/olivetti.shtml>Olivetti</a> page (which I thought was quite funny =) to my <a href=../stuff/index.shtml>StUfF</a>.``xAupVyklAAVyefSoxA``x940570099``x(default)
Poll``xOliver``xSome morons were voting for "horrible" for moronic reasons, so I've editted the poll 'just a little bit' ;) Communist? Freedom of speech? Bias? Bad statistical analysis? What? Of course not. What do you think this is? Gallup? ;)``xAupuZkkFuxZnvbEoN``x940479434``x(default)
Yet more pics!``xOliver``xI've added eight more pics to the <a href=../pics/index.shtml>Pics!</a> section, making pages <a href=../pics/6/index.shtml>-6-</a>, and <a href=../pics/7/index.shtml>-7-</a>. Have fun! =) Oh yeah...<br>Phoooey to you people who voted "horrible" in my poll! =) I'm Computer Club President, which just shows how l337 I am! ;) Should I carry on the Computer Club tradition and do absolutely nothing? Or should we actually do something this year?<br>I've also added the random quotes to the top of every page. If you have good, fun quotes, <a href=mailto:iamdamanfearme@oliverweb.com>email me</a>. ;)``xAupFlAZFkWvAUyNqe``x940396932``x(default)
Pics and Stuff``xOliver``xI've added the <a href=../pics/index.shtml>Pics!</a> section to OliverWEB. Funny stuff there. =) You have got to <a href=../pics/index.shtml>check it out</a>. I've only been able to scan in eight pics at the time of this posting, but there'll be more (very possibly by the time you read this =). Also, I changed the text color to a light grey... how's it look? =)``xAupkAVpyEOyCLWTqj``x940302261``x(default)
Eye strain?``xOliver``xDoes any part of the site put a strain on your eyes? I think it's fine, but my parents said the grey text was too hard to read (it's white now)... <a href=mailto:me@oliverweb.com>let me know</a> what you think.``xAupkElElyJDVSbFDq``x940225386``x(default)
A bit more...``xOliver``xI just spiced up the page a bit more with the "Idiot Outside" image and the poll, and the random quote generator, and the counter (bottom of right sidebar)... and... umm... oh, I guess that's it =) I guess I didn't really have to tell you guys that, but oh well =)``xAupkEVpVEotDeCQCY``x940222251``x(default)
Yet more StUfF``xOliver``xWow, I'm adding a lot of stuff today =) Okay, I've added a <a href=../stuff/index.shtml>StUfF</a> page to OliverWEB. =) It will be my misc. page. Oh, and if any of you want me to link to your site, just <a href=mailto:youknowthis@oliverweb.com>email me</a> your site name and URL and I'll add it to the "More Stuff" sidebar. Hmmm... anything else?... Oh yeah, make sure you guys at least sign the <a href=../guestbook/index.shtml>Guestbook</a> when you visit here so I know who's been here without having to search through all my logs...``xAupkplFEystaquauw``x940215516``x(default)
New Sections!``xOliver``xI've added the <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/about/index.shtml>About OliverWEB</a> and <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/pointlessjunk/index.shtml>Pointless Junk</a> pages to OliverWEB and to the sidebar. Oohhhh Aaahhhh... Having fun yet? =) Can't wait for those pics...``xAupEAZEEFliIsHDwg``x940204313``x(default)
Grand Opening!``xOliver``xWelcome to the GRAND OPENING of OliverWEB! =) Not everything is up yet (and I assure you, there will be tons more stuff). Today, I'll be getting some pictures from HEB... I'll scan them in tonight maybe. Right now, the <a href="../wwwboard/index.shtml">message board</a>, <a href="../guestbook/index.shtml">guestbook</a>, and <a href="../boredom2/index.html">Boredom2</a> (including <a href="../boredom2/quotes/index.shtml">Quotes</a>) pages are up. Make sure you check them all out ;) Have fun!<p>Oh, and there will be tons of inside jokes on this site... so if something seems weird, strange, or whatever (like the "Anon is funny" part in the <a href="../index.shtml">intro</a>) it's probably an inside joke. =)``xAupElEAFuJPRSgYlU``x940189134``x(default)
