<p><b><font face="arial" color="#003399">Musical Magic (NOT FRUIT)</font> </b><font face="arial" size="1">Monday, January 7, 2002</font><br><font size="2" face="arial">Everyone should come to the Musical that the McNeil group is putting on.  It is called Working and although it is homosexual and patriotic...if you don't believe me on those... ask anyone related to the musical in any way... except for Dye or chipper little girls... <br>Anyway, it is January 23-26 which is Wed-Saturday just in case you were wondering... I don't know how much it costs though.  But come for love, devotion, and free food. (Love, devotion, and free food not guaranteed.)  Oh and keep checking Mr.Techhappy, cuz something may have just popped up since the last time you went there!<br><b>-<a href="mailto:bshelley@austin.rr.com">Brook</a></b></font><br>

Oliver is STILL sleeping away underneath a pink blanket and Doris and Matt are reading an...Xmen book i think, but i think they are substituting names with Orbit, Matt, and Doris. Yeah....and i think, matt is spose to be judging again at noon, but it's like 15 till and we're still sitting here...and that's all oliver's fault. he was spose to get up 6 hours ago! How does oliver sleep through this? I stole 3 of this stuffed animals, i mean 4, a ninja turtle, Super Smash Brothers, Titanic Soundtrack, a natural science tshirt, and i was going to steal this carpet stain remover but his mom said it mite spill. But she provided me a plastic bag to carry my stolen goods away. <br><b>-<a href="mailto:oliver@oliverweb.com">Oliver</a></b></font><br>
