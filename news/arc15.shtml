<p><b><font face="arial" color="#003399">Even Still...</font> </b><font face="arial" size="1">Thursday, October 18, 2001</font><br><font size="2" face="arial">Though Chad still continues to hate all entities that post on this website (excluding Wes, he rocks). As a manifestation of anger, i will not allow any comments to a post set forth by me. Recent data has indicated that i might implode, but this data was inconclusive and found to be an isolated incident. Further sampling has found that the only results of no commenting is incessant posting on the web page, carrying one underlying motif: hatred. Hatred does make the world turn. The common consensus states that, as evil as war is, it spurns the movement of life. Absence of war would indicate, in turn, the absence of flaws in humanity. So i shall forgive the failure of insolent whelps such as yourselves have in commenting, whereas it simply exemplifies the warlike nature of your flawed minds, and also your desire to bomb every country in the world, cause that's where terrorists live.<br><br><a href="http://www.mrtechhappy.com/chad/">Make sure and have your volume turned up...</a><br><br><b>-<a href="mailto:nosliwc156@aol.com">Chad</a></b></font><br>

<p><b><font face="arial" color="#003399">About Chad...</font> </b><font face="arial" size="1">Thursday, October 18, 2001</font><br><font size="2" face="arial">If you pay careful attention to this site, you will notice that the post directly below this one, as well as a few others on this page, came from Chad... trying to show off his webpage... You have to look carefully, because I do believe the addition of his name sort of camoflauges any post, but it is there.  When you find it, I have a request... do not, under any circumstances, post a comment, as this will surely make him sad.  Chad enjoys his posts having no comments, and if that were ever to change, Chad would surely explode (or implode, research data still out) So remember, no commenting... he hates us, we should ignore him =)<br><b>-<a href="mailto:minix1f@aol.com">Minix</a></b></font><br>
