<p><b><font face="arial" color="#003399">Ochs</font> </b><font face="arial" size="1">Sunday, July 1, 2001</font><br><font size="2" face="arial">Bravo man... really, I "applaud" you. You've been successful in deleting a few quotes and memories from OliverWEB. Great job, really. I don't know if I could have done it better myself.<br><br>I could just email this to you, but I know you'll read it here. I've got nothing to hide, perhaps you do? I could very well go through every strand of OliverWEB and take off every reference of you... how would you like that? I won't... I'll be the bigger man right now. I won't lower myself to your level. Getting pissed yet? You have a problem with that. Read on. Perhaps you should think through things a bit more before you actually do things. That's a novel idea, <i>think</i>. Wow. <br><br>You need help man, I'm sorry... I don't think I can anymore. Perhaps you've forgotten all the times I've tried. After all this, do you still not see clearly, are you still all tangled up in your pride? Wow, you're 18 now... that makes you a man, right? Yeah, just like how wearing that black belt makes you a super cool martial arts dude. Let me tell you something. And make sure you listen and understand, because you've probably had some trouble thinking lately. It means <i>nothing</i>. Nothing at all. Think you're a man? Can handle your own life? Deep within, you're not a man, you're a whining little brat foul mouthing every person around him because things didn't go your way.<br><br>Stop trying to control people... you can't, you won't, and you'll only end up screwing your own life up while hurting others in the process. Am I pissed right now? Yes. Another congratulations to you man, you got Oliver mad. Few have been able to achieve that task. That make you the best? The smartest dude ever? Give me a break. You didn't even "hack" into OliverWEB. You *knew* my quote page password... that's smart thinking there, let me tell you. You broke a trust, have I ever broken a trust to hurt you?<br><br>Perhaps you weren't the one who messed with the page? Let's look into this, shall we? You knew my password. It was a few days/hours (I don't know, I was in Dallas) after I erased your account(s) on OliverWEB, so you have a motive. "To each his own..." has you written all over it. Perhaps it wasn't you? No, scratch that idea. <br><br>I urge you to look within yourself and see how truly twisted you are right now. There's a song that goes "humble thyself in the sight of the Lord"... maybe you've sung it before? You should listen to the words from your own mouth. Really, you should. I said I was mad, but do I hate you? No, I will never hate you no matter what you do. I am sorry for you, I'm sorry our friendship has gotten to become like this, I'm sorry there <i>is no friendship</i> anymore.<br><br>May God be with you and open your eyes. You'll need Him.<br><br>-To the others reading this, please don't add any "scolding" in the comments. Let this be.<br><b>-<a href="mailto:oliver@oliverweb.com">Oliver</a></b></font><br>

<p><b><font face="arial" color="#003399">An interesting tidbit</font> </b><font face="arial" size="1">Tuesday, June 26, 2001</font><br><font size="2" face="arial">Lala, and now, something from the Bible... (sorry for the language... other bible in car... and this ones kind of old)<br><br>OK, oldest guy in the bible... was Methuselah who lived to 969 years old... how do you think he died?  I would guess... Old age... but...<br><br>Genesis 5:26  "And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred and sixty and nine years: and he died"<br><br>his son, Lemach was born when Methuselah was 187<br><br>Genesis 5:25 "And Methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech"<br><br>and then, Lemach had a son, Noah<br><br>Genesis 5:28-29 "And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son, (29) and he called his name Noah.<br><br>Genesis 7:6 "And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth"<br><br>lala... 187+182+600 = 969... which means that Methuselah either died the year of the flood, or in the flood... <br><br>Pretty cool I thought =)<br><br><b>-<a href="mailto:minix1f@aol.com">Minix</a></b></font><br>

<p><b><font face="arial" color="#003399">Memorable Moments</font> </b><font face="arial" size="1">Monday, June 25, 2001</font><br><font size="2" face="arial">Was looking through the quote archives... just thought I'd throw some of the quotes up here for fun. =)<blockquote><i>"Yes, my Hard Drive is being used up at a constantly increasing rate no thanks to your no good scum sucking emails so if you don't mind, then STOP GIVING ME THOSE !#$%!!$! THINGS!!!!!! Ahem, if you see me in the halls next year you better either run real fast or else smash yourself into the brick wall and save me the trouble, okay? Oh yeah, have a nice day." -Van<br><br>"I AM YODA!!!!" -Olivia<br><br>"Backstreet Boys and NSync are almost exactly alike, I don't know how people can say one is better than the other. Personally, I like NSync better." - "Anon"<br><br>"stupid Sarah " -Oliver<br><br>"If I were a fruit, I'd like to be one with pink tights and fake boobys like you see on 6th street." -Chad<br><br>"Hey, is that Santa Claus? He gives me lovely presents, just like my furry easter rabitts hand out eggs, to iraq got bombed today in a series of star wars is a bad movie" -Minix<br><br>"Stuff that not mean we think was stuff that was we dont" -Minix<br><br>LASSIE'S A BLONDE TOOOOOOO! yay!!!! " -Sarah</i></blockquote><br>Well, those are a few that stood out for now... I'd just like to note that a lot of Minix's quotes seem like random words just thrown in there and make no sense at all. =) Speaking of quotes, I think I'm goin to redo the whole random quote generator thing up there... hasn't had a revamp in a year or so. =)<br><b>-<a href="mailto:oliver@oliverweb.com">Oliver</a></b></font><br>
