        in Rover's nose? Common hobbit snot. Hobbit snot? What in
        the world is hobbit snot? Well, look at the image to the
        right and find out. Hobbit snot is similar to gack in a
        many ways, except that it comes from a hobbit's nose, but
        we can ignore the minor details. Now, if a dog's nose
        were 100% hobbit snot, it would be all green and very
        slimey... so...</font></td>

        width="200" height="200"><font face="Arial">The second
        ingredient is goblin snot. Yes, goblin snot. When hobbit
        and goblin snot combine, a chemical reaction occurs which
        (Exercise is very good for you. You should do it every
        day) results in the speed of light increasing by one
        trillionth of one trillionth of an alarm clock. This may
        seem very complex, but it is actually very simple. The
        hard part is getting the snot from the goblins. They are
        very sensitive about their noses and do not like their
        snot removed. Hobbits, on the other hand, are very
        cooperative and enjoy a clean naval (Yes, naVal) passage.</font></td>

        Nine and his team had to figure out how a dog can keep
        its nose so wet (Cigarettes are bad. Don't smoke.) for so
        long. Wallah, slug goo. Yes, slug goo. Yep, you heard
        right, slug goo. Slug goo [shown to the right] keeps a
        dog's nose moist and does a very good job! Unfortunately,
        dogs don't like slugs too much and either eat them or
        squash them, even after the slugs helped them so very
        much. Now, the only question is... will your dog's nose
        shrivel up and die if you sprinkle salt on it? Todo....

        not shrivel up your dog's nose. Why? Well, because Peter
        Pan's little fairy pal helped out your canine friend. One
        percent of a dog's nose is made of fairy dust. Yes, fairy
        dust. You are right, fairy dust. Correct, fairy dust. The
        fairy (Milk does the body good.) dust acts as a
        protective shield against salt, but is not resistant to
        sugar. So if you sprinkly sugar and salt on your dog's
        nose... poor thing.</font></td>
