<p><font face="Arial">There is one question that plagues us all.
&quot;What if Huck Finn was running at the speed of light and
spit?&quot; You know you ask it everyday. It is the one question
that all of us seek the answer to. What is the answer?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">At the National Huck Institution, they have
a handful of possible answers. The first theory, is that Huck
will slow down very very minutely to sub-speed of light, then the
spit will travel at the speed of light. This is a boring theory,
so it was discarded.</font></p>

<p><img src="spit.gif" align="left" hspace="0" width="325"
height="210"><font face="Arial">The next theory is that the spit
will go faster than the speed of light. This will cause the spit
to, theoretically, go back in time... which will cause the spit
to hit poor Huck in the face before he even spit it out. Imagine
that. This theory was hilarious, we like it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Icecream, you scream, we all scream for
icecream. People like to run around and do stuff. It's weird.
Homework. Evil. We hate homework. Homework stinks. Ever wonder
why Windows 95/98 crashes SOOO much? Me too. Wabba wabba. I know
this paragraph is totally out of wack, but hey, who cares? You
expected stuff like this when you clicked on the link to read it.
Don't lie. You did. Didn't you?! ANSWER ME! Fine, don't answer
me. You know, it's the inconsiderate people like you who leave
the toilets unflushed at the public bathrooms. You sicko. I don't
even want you reading this. Okay, I want you to read this. Become
my loyal reader. READ.</font></p>

<p><img src="time.gif" align="right" hspace="0" width="298"
height="269"><font face="Arial">But what if Huck wasn't running?
What if he was spinning at the speed of light? Then...
theoretically, time would stop for Huck. Would he run into his
spit after he spit? Who knows? Do you actually think this stuff
is factual? Well.. maybe it is, maybe it's not. Who knows? I
wanna go home. Take me home. I can fly!!!! Actually, no I can't.
Have a nice day.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The next theory is that... Huck would never
run at the speed of light and this whole article is a waste of
server space. What in the world are you still reading for? Stop
reading. NOW. Why are you reading this even though I told you to
stop reading? Don't make me come out of the monitor and beat you
up! STOP READING NOW or you'll regret it! Oh, hold on, I gotta go
pee.</font></p>
