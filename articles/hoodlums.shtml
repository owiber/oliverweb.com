        <p><font face="Arial">AUSTIN, TEXAS: Five hoodlums were
        spotted today leaving from McNeil High School and
        traveling to Cedar Valley Middle School, where they
        presumably waved at the local middle schoolers,
        petrifying their immature brains. &nbsp; </font></p>

        &quot;It's sad,&quot; commented Principle Atchley,
        &quot;the kids had so much brain power to be scarred for
        life by a bunch of teenage hoodlums.&quot; At this time,
        there is no known defense against the hoodlums' insane
        attack. &nbsp; </font></p>

        only did they attack the middle schoolers, they also
        attacked helpless pedestrians and drivers. &quot;I was
        terrified,&quot; sobbed a pedestrian (who chose to have
        her name withheld), &quot;they came out from nowhere and
        started waving at me. Laughing as they drove by. It was
        disgusting.&quot; The pedestrian and at least a dozen
        other victims are now going through mental treatment to
        start the healing process. &quot;I've never seen anything
        like it,&quot; said a doctor, &quot;it's horrible. The
        victims are marred mentally. I'm not sure if we can heal
        them, but we will try. We will not lose hope.&quot;

        align="right" hspace="0" height=196 width=144></font><font face="Arial">The
        attackers could not be identified as they were wearing a
        bear, alien, Jason, red hood, and Batman masks. One
        attacker was even reported to have been wearing a huge
        sombrero. &quot;We will not stop until these hoodlums are
        caught and taught a lesson,&quot; said Officer Bob.
        &quot;Unfortunately, we do not have the attackers'
        license plate number as all the victims were put into too
        much of a shock to remember it.&quot; &nbsp; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The horrible attacks ended before
        5:00 PM, when the attackers allegedly split up and hid.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><center><img

        The attacks have ended, but the danger is still there.
        Lock your children in the homes, don't let them look both
        ways before they cross the street (as they may spot the
        hoodlums and their hoodlumobile). Getting run over and
        squashed is a much better end than to be destroyed by
        these sick hoodlum monsters. Get all your windows of your
        car tinted so that you cannot see out. &nbsp; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Beware.</font></p>
