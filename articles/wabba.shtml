<p align="left">There is a condition, known as <em>The Wabba Mood</em>.
The &quot;victim&quot; will experience a state of 'highness', act
very very weird, and say the stupidest things. And that's only
the start of it. </p>

<p align="left">Medical research has been unable to discover the
cause of this strange mood. Symptoms of <em>The Wabba Mood</em>
are constant exclamation of &quot;Wabba&quot; (which is usually
used in doubles or triples, such as: &quot;Wabba wabba!&quot;),
proposal to one or multiple people, crazy gibberish, and much
macho talking. The victim may also lose control and start
laughing hysterically.</p>

<p align="left">Currently, the mood seems to pass after a few
minutes to an hour, but much damage can be caused during those
few hours. If anyone is in <em>The Wabba Mood</em>, ignore them
and everything they say. The victim will make a very good
comedian during this period and you may enjoy the laugh, but
beware.. <em>The Wabba Mood</em> is contagious! If you are around
a <em>Wabba</em> person for too long, you too may become <em>Wabba</em>.
Doctors are currently trying to discover first the cause of the
mood, then to find a cure for it. </p>
