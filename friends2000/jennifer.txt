<li>I saw it too!! It was awesome!! =) =) =)!!! I wish I could dance like that! There was a girl in one of my dance classes once who had a Mom just like the pushy stage mom in that movie. It makes me sick. =P -<u><b><font color=#FF00FF>Amanda</font></u></b>
<li>Yeah, I know! I was almost crying when that girl...Morine..was talking to her mom during the performance. Oh my gosh...I could never do that. I'm soooo seeing that again!! -<u><b><font color=#800080>Jennifer</font></u></b>
<li>Oh I know! Wasn't it? I Loooooved the dancing :) I liked that one class that she went to for a change from ballet... it was cool! -<u><b><font color=#8000FF>Sarah</font></u></b>
<li>I SAW IT!! I JUST SAW CENTER STAGE!!! OH MY GOSH..THAT WAS SOOOOOO GOOD!!! Haha..I wish I could dance like that...*sigh* -<u><b><font color=#800080>Jennifer</font></u></b>
<li>Center Stage is a dance movie that's been out for a few weeks...and I REALLY WANT TO SEE IT!!!! -<u><b><font color=#800080>Jennifer</font></u></b>
<li>What movie is Center Stage? And, yeah.. I agree that those easy dance things aren't a sport, cause ur not really doing anything. But I mean, when you're a professional or really dedicated to it.. oh yeah baby, it a sport! =) -<u><b><font color=#0080C0>Olivia</font></u></b>
<li>*sigh* NO! I STILL HAVEN'T SEEN CENTER STAGE!!!! I want to soooo bad!! But I haven't had a chance to yet...well, nevermind, yes I have...but I didn't want to go with this person and give him the wrong idea...nevermind...anyway!! but I will!  -<u><b><font color=#800080>Jennifer</font></u></b>
<li>I don't know...but I heard it was listed as a sport somewhere..I don't remember where -<u><b><font color=#800080>Jennifer</font></u></b>
<li>I've seen "dance with me"... yeah, you're right Jennifer. Have you seen "Center Stage"?? It was sooo good! The dancing at least. Parts of the plot were kind of... eh... but the dancing was cool.  -<u><b><font color=#8000FF>Sarah</font></u></b>
<li>Chess? Who considers chess a sport!?! Bowling... I guess maybe... -<u><b><font color=#0000FF>Oliver</font></u></b>
<li>Well...actually, ballroom dancing might be able to...it depends on how advanced you get...if you've ever seen Dance With Me, you'd understand, but you're right..the easy stuff really isn't. But it's a lot closer to a sport than chess or bowling, and those are considered sports!! -<u><b><font color=#800080>Jennifer</font></u></b>
<li>Well, it depends on your definition of dance... like... ball-room dancing, not sure if I would consider that a sport... but stuff like ballet or other kinda stuff like that I would, yes... -<u><b><font color=#0000FF>Oliver</font></u></b>
<li>COULD BE?!?! IT IS! And so is karate! Who thinks karate or dance isn't a sport? I'll BEAT THEM UP! HAHA, j/j... I think.. =) -<u><b><font color=#0080C0>Olivia</font></u></b>
<li>It COULD be a sport?? No, IT IS!!! -<u><b><font color=#800080>Jennifer</font></u></b>
<li>As with karate as well... -<u><b><font color=#0000FF>Oliver</font></u></b>
<li>I was KIDDING, I think it could be a sport. -<u><b><font color=#0000FF>Oliver</font></u></b>
<li>Hey!! Dance is too a sport! In Dance class, we have to do 200 crunches every day!! I mean, if that isn't hard, I don't know what is! And yes, I am a dancer too, although not anywhere near as good as Jennifer is. =) -<u><b><font color=#FF00FF>Amanda</font></u></b>
<li>Haha...dance IS TOO A SPORT!!! Ask Olivia..she's seen me after practice..I'm all sweaty and gross just like any other athlete is. And like the shirt Amanda made me says.."Don't think dancers are atheletes? THINK AGAIN!!" -<u><b><font color=#800080>Jennifer</font></u></b>
<li>Football is a dumb sport where big hunky people get paid millions (which could better used in helping the needy/starving/etc.) to slam into each other and try to act as walls or dogs catching a ball. Lol... =) -<u><b><font color=#0000FF>Oliver</font></u></b>
<li>AH! DANCE IS A BETTER SPORT THAN SISSY GUY SPORTS! In football, you kill eachother! Dance is so awesome! GO Jennifer! -<u><b><font color=#0080C0>Olivia</font></u></b>
