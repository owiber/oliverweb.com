<b>"About Sarah putting down Clarinets in her rant..... I've played music before where Clarinets had the most important part and the flutes backed US up.(Tacobell's cannon, Livi ;) And most of the time the first clarinets have the same part as the flue, just lower. In fact, a lot of time Clarinets are given the melody BECAUSE they can go lower. So, just thought I'd say a few words on an instrument close to my heart. =)"</b> [<u><font color=#FF00FF>Amanda</font></u>]

<li>Of course he does.;) -<u><b><font color=#FF00FF>Amanda</font></u></b>
<li>OH blah you don't count. =) -<u><b><font color=#8000FF>Sarah</font></u></b>
<li>Being a huge fan of the trombone...I must say, go Trombones, but for the sake of argument, I must say go Clarinets! -<u><b><font color=#008000>Minix</font></u></b>
<li>LoL... I seriously didn't mean this as a war against clarinets. It started as just supporting flutes... clarinets was just one example of what Olivia H. said. ANYWAY... the main point is that flute ARE essential. And trumpets are not better than anyone else. :) -<u><b><font color=#8000FF>Sarah</font></u></b>
<li>You know what? GO AIR MOLECULES!!! -<u><b><font color=#0000FF>Oliver</font></u></b>
<li>Trust me.... when Clarinets play high notes, we can project..... but flutes usually project more, just becuase they're higher instruments.... and really, if you ask me, all instruments are important in a band.... I mean, music just sounds flat without the small back up parts. GO CLARINETS!! =) -<u><b><font color=#FF00FF>Amanda</font></u></b>
<li>Okay, let's end this and go... GO WOODWINDS! My gosh! =)~ -<u><b><font color=#0080C0>Olivia</font></u></b>
<li>Well yeah, it happens Sometimes. I mean for gosh sakes sometimes a song is written for the timpani! But does that mean it's a really important instrument? Not really... but I don't really have anything against clarinets.. that was just my example. But see... clarinets don't have many huge parts written for them because they can't project well. I dunno.... GO FLUTES!! -<u><b><font color=#8000FF>Sarah</font></u></b>
