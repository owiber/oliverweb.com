Do you know the game "Guess the number"?

<p>
The game is played by two players, Thinker and Guesser. Thinker
secretly chooses an integer from an interval known to both players and
Guesser tries to guess it asking questions. Guesser's questions are of
the form: "I think your number is xx." Thinker has three posible
answers &ndash; "You're right", "No, my number is smaller than xx" or "No,
my number is greater than xx".  Guesser's goal is to guess the
Thinker's number with minimum number of questions.

<p>
A few days ago, we finished building the Thinking Meatmincer (TM). The
TM has a simple user interface: you insert the data (instead of bits,
basic units of TM data are Meats) to the input hole (IH), turn the
handle a few times and the result will drop out from the output hole
(OH). However, there is a catch - the handle can be turned only if
there is a new input in IH.

<p>
As the name suggests, TM should be computationally equivalent to
Turing Machine, but we haven't performed extensive testing yet. We
would like to ask you to assist us in an experiment. You will play
game of "Guess the number" in the role of Guesser against the TM in
the role of Thinker.

<h3>Task specification</h3>
<p>

One submission is equivalent to inserting one Meat (remember, Meat is
not the same as "piece of meat") into TM and turning the handle
once. After doing this enough times, TM will produce its first output
(which will be sent to you). Since then, each following submission
will cause one output to be produced.
<span class="ipsc2004-d-warn">NOTE THAT THIS TASK IS SPECIAL: THE 
MAXIMAL NUMBER OF SUBMITS MIGHT BE GREATER THAN 10</span> 
(read the input specification for further information).

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
From your point of view, the exchange might look as follows:

<p>
You -&gt; Mincer: 3<br>
Mincer -&gt; You: There is one Meat inside<br>
You -&gt; Mincer: 5<br>
Mincer -&gt; You: There are two Meats inside<br>
You -&gt; Mincer: 4<br>
Mincer -&gt; You: Mincer full, output: "My number is GREATER than 3"<br>
You -&gt; Mincer: 32<br>
Mincer -&gt; You: Mincer full, output: "My number is SMALLER than 5"<br>
You -&gt; Mincer: 51<br>
Mincer -&gt; You: Mincer full, output: "You're RIGHT, it's 4"<br>
</p>

<h3>Input specification</h3>
<p>
The input file contains three numbers: <b>N</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>S</b>. 
Thinker can choose a number between <b>1</b> and <b>N</b> inclusive.
The number <b>D</b> denotes the 
number of turns of the handle before the first output appears. In other
words, you'll get the first useful output from Thinker after your 
<b>(D+1)</b>-th submission. In the example above we used <b>D=2</b>.
The number <b>S</b> denotes the maximal number of submits
you may make to solve this input.
</p>

<h3>Submission specification</h3>
<p>
Each submit should contain exactly one integer &ndash; your guess. 
This integer must be in the range from <b>1</b> to <b>N</b> (inclusive).
After each submit you will receive a message similar to one of the messages
in the example above.
