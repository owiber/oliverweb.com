A young archeologist Senoj Anaidni recently made a very important
discovery which will make him famous (or at least he thinks so).  He
found several scraps of paper resembling advertisement flyers of an
ancient phone company. His research showed that modern phone companies
follow a few basic rules to compose their flyers (and there
is no reason to assume that old companies were an exception).
</p>
<p>
Each company operates certain number of phone lines. Each phone line
connects a pair of cities, and it can be used in both directions.  The
cost of using each line is a fixed positive number. A call from city A
to city B may be routed through one or more other cities, in which
case the cost of the call is the sum of the costs of all lines used.
(In fact, sometimes it is cheaper to route the call through several
other cities than to use the direct connection, even if there exists
one.)
</p>
<p>
To make the information comprehensible to the customer, the phone
company lists the cost of the cheapest possible call between every
pair of cities serviced by the company. To impress the customer even
more, the company also lists the number of lines it operates.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, each of Senoj's ancient flyers start like this: "Using our 47
telephone lines, we serve 10 most important cities of the world! A
call from Sparta to Troja costs 12 dennario, Sparta to Athens is 15
dennario, ...". The list of all pairs of cities and the respective
costs of the cheapest possible call between them follows.
</p>
<p>
This supports Senoj's hypothesis about the origin of the papers, but
he is not sure whether they are really genuine. Other archeologists
often play dirty jokes on him by making ridiculous forgeries in a
hope, that he will make a fool of himself. Luckily, they are often not
very meticulous, so we can safely assume, that a flyer is a forgery if
and only if it could not have been published by any phone company.
</p>

<h3>Input specification</h3>
<p>
The first line of the input file gives the number of flyers found by
Senoj. Each flyer is described in a separate block starting with a
line containing two integers - <b>N</b> and <b>K</b> - where <b>N</b> is the number of
cities and <b>K</b> is the number of phone lines. The block continues with
<b>N-1</b> lines giving the costs of the cheapest calls between all pairs of
cities.  In particular, the <b>i</b>-th line contains <b>(N-i)</b> numbers, where
<b>j</b>-th number represents the cost of a call between the cities <b>i</b> and
<b>(i+j)</b>.
</p>

<h3>Output specification</h3>
<p>
For every input block, output a line containing either "YES" or "NO".
"YES" should be printed, if it is possible to assign costs to the
phone lines operated by the company so that the cheapest calls are as
advertised in the flyer. "NO" should be printed if this is not
possible.
