        <p align="left">15 years
        ago, a child was born. Her name was... SARAH (Stupid. As.
        Real. Aggies. Hah.). This page is dedicated to the
        remembrance on that event, which led to many many... many
        tragic events.</p>
        <p align="left"><img
        src="BABY.gif" align="left" hspace="0" width="229"
        height="315">At the
        age of two, this is what Sarah looked like. Not much has
        changed, as you can see. In a few years after this photo
        was taken, Sarah began work on her evil plan to take over
        the world.</p>
        <p align="left">Sarah
        would buy every toilet cover in the world. Every toilet
        cover making company, every toilet cover patent,
        everything relating to a toilet cover. Soon, every toilet
        cover in the world would disappear. Total chaos would
        ensue. Oh yes, the males of the human race would not
        care, but the females... Oh the females! The woman-folk
        would riot. Couples would argue over and over again about
        trying to close the toilet seat cover. But... alas! There
        were NO MORE TOILET COVERS!<p>
