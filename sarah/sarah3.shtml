        another world power grew. Oliver Wong, conquerer of
        Microsoft Corporation became El Minix's and Sarah's arch
        enemy for world domination. Oliver's Wyndoes XX machines
        battled Minix's Batman action figures and Sarah's killer
        toilet covers. Eventually, the Windows XX machines were
        overpowered... but then... Oliver unleashed the powerful
        Off-Ice 2000 class machines. The toilet covers and
        Batmans could not withstand the power of the Off-Ice
        machines, so they lost.</p>

        <p align="left">Okay.. I
        was just joking around.</p>
