        the whole world was trapped in Sarah's... trap. There
        were no more toilet covers. What were we to do? Soon
        Sarah had the whole world in her grasp... then... the one
        known as El Minix proposed to her and they got married.
        Critics today believe that this was Sarah's downfall. El
        Minix soon took over Sarah's operations and together...
        they ruled for a while.</p>
        <p align="left">That is...
        until one day... El Minix went insane and thought that he
        was Batman. Soon, Sarah and El Minix were fighting and
        throwing toilet seat covers everywhere. The people who
        caught the covers rejoiced as they now had a toilet
        cover! Men from all over the world came to claim their
        own toilet cover to give to their wives as gifts. A
        toilet cover was valued at more than $100,000 per cover.</p>
