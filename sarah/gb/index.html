I'd like to point out, that I'm in college... and I still remember you... which you said I wouldn't... and you said if I did, you'd bring me food... yet I see no food... meanie =)  of course... I did stop writing the 2000 word emails... heh, sorry... maybe i'll replicate that... im hungry =)  you're never going to read this too =)</b><br>

<b>Well you told me to do one with my name. So here it is. Wahoooooooleyhoo!! Should I act normal? Nah...I'll write a 2000 word email in here. HEHEHEHEHAHAHASHHAHAHAHOOHHOHOHOHOHOho you thought I'd sign this normal! Ha! Well I will add something normal. Great page Sarah! And dont worry I wont forget you! Glad I make you ramble... I think =) Yeah!!! What to write what to write? How many people check this? I like writing. Write write write. Should I put my car story? Nah... my poem!! Let me get it...here we go My Poem I tend to write like Goofy. You know, the Disney Dog. This makes other people spoofy. Not a word, but sounds gog. That was a typo I assure you. I meant to write good. But my finger split in two. I cut it on some wood. I screamed at the top of my lungs, “I want to pass! I really don’t want to be hung.” But then Ms. K flung me on my a— That was a typo too, I can’t believe you! What did you think I meant to do?! You stupid shrew. I did not say that to be rude. Really, honest, I know you didn’t mean harm, I’m just in a bad mood. I woke up at 3:30 today due to my alarm. I hope you remember you said ‘Original Poem’ And this is original! I don’t want to hide at home, Right next to my urinal. Maybe I should run and hide. Please don’t tell my mom, I shouldn’t have lied. When I get home I’m sure to find a bomb, My parents don’t find my creativity, clever… They will yell and scream and shout, “I’m not supporting you in this endeavor.” And I will just site there and pout. Thank you, Thank you. that probably looks horrible! Well since it wont let me post new stuff...I should write as much as possible in here... I want to write you a poem...but I dont think I should now =) anyway, tata </b><br>
