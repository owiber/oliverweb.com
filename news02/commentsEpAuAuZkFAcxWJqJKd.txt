It happens in human relationship here on earth because we are sinners.  In relationship where pain/suffering does happen, some grow some do not. This depends on their obedience and faith. God will only work healing/growth where there is faith and obedience.  Look at all the healing miracles Jesus did. They all required faith from someone. Now, I need to have something clarified. The grow...is that grow in faith in God, or grow in love toward each other, or grow in self/character?<Br><Br>

Because God created Adam and Eve, and since God is not the source of evil, i.e. sin, Adam and Eve were sinless before they ate the fruit.  But God warned them that if they ate of the fruit they would face death (Gen 3.3).  Once Adam and Eve disobeyed God, sin entered into the world.  Because of Adam's sin, we are now all sinners (Romans 5.19).  That's were Jesus Christ comes in.   Through Christ and only through Christ (John 14.6) can a man have forgiveness of sin ( Romans 3.9-31), we as sinners cannot do anything.  Jesus Christ has to do it all.  <Br><Br>There will be no more pain and suffering in heaven, because there will be no more sin.  There will be a great judgement when Christ comes back and send all of sin to hell.  Meaning those that have not believed in Christ.  Here's something to think about, if God asked \"Why should I allow you into heaven?\"  More importantly, \"Who is Jesus Christ to you?  and what have you done with Him?\"  Answer these questions and compare them to what the bible says.  <Br><Br>Please feel free to email me at stix111@hotmail.com if you have any questions. <Br><Br>Hector<Br>
