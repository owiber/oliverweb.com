The older titanium PBs had worse reception though.  I have pretty decent signal all throughout my house though.

1091048457``xComment``xOliver``xa``x``xyeah, I think they should have made the whole PB case the antenna, I don't know why they didn't... or if they did, they did a poor job of it.
1091167312``xComment``xGrant Gorton``xa``xtgorton@gmail.com``xI think making the whole case an antenna wouldn't work.  the frequencies would get all jacked up.  I still have decent reception though...anywhere in my house I have three bars...and in my room, I always have 4..I havne't tried the basement though...and I haven't tried outside....It hasn't really been an issue for me..though when I first got my pb, I had trouble at brook's appartement..don't know why..it didn't happen the last time I was there.
