1040053156``xMovies everyday, all the time``xAndrew``xa``x``xWell Sean, 11pm on Wednesday is the scheduled time.  Everyone has tickets for that one and we will see it then.  The midnight run is just for those guys who want to watch the movies more than once.  Since they sold out at Gateway, Mark and I decided we're going to Killeen to see Equilibrium and the LOTR midnight show.  Plus I'm going everyone else on Thursday to Killeen for Nemesis and Equilibrium again.  5 movies, 3 days, and a whole lot of fun.
