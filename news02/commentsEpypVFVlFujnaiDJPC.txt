Well, as soon as the came out last week, I also planned to install them onto my computer so I downloaded the P4 version, the athlon version, and of course the basic one.  Then I thought, might as well wait until school starts and install the packages through the mirrors (I don't want to use the preinstalled packages, I think I just like knowing I compiled that from a mirror).  So that's what I think I'm going to do.  So Baghat will be changed to Gentoo, my laptop will have gentoo, and of course my desktop will too.  What would I have done without this linux distro????

Boy, this thing is prettt neat.  Having the Dual Xeon's make it fast and I like the options for booting.  <Br><Br>The only thing I had a complaint with was with packaged drivers.  Essentially, they don't work.  I had install them without the drivers and then try to upgrade the drivers.  A nasty process to say the least.  And right now, it's not recognizing the NIS server.  Oh well, more lab time for me.
