1073778739``xComment``xOliver``xa``x``xw00t, thanks Minix...<Br><Br>I'm running into some hurdles with PostNuke. Having to come up with weird work-arounds to get stuff I want done.<Br><Br>What I want to do is something like this:<Br><Br>http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/designs/liquid/04/04phase4blue.png<Br><Br>Where I can update the \"Liquid Updates\" section with small text blurbs like in that image, and then an article-type section (called \"Richie's Corner\" in that layout) that is basically exactly like an article except that it is seperate from all the other normal ones and only the 1 most recent one is shown on the frontpage.  Then, the normal articles are all below that.<Br><Br>Archiving and all that junk is of course required... but I think all CMS's do that.
1073778819``xComment``xOliver``xa``x``xErhm... yeah, in PostNuke, I'm having trouble seperating the \"Richie's Corner\" stuff from the normal articles, as well as coming up with a nice way to do the Liquid Updates. 
1073785892``xComment``xMinix``xa``xminix@westmercuryx.com``xOk, I just wrote something to respond, but it was poorly done so I'm going to try again.<Br><Br>I have only looked at PostNuke with the open source cms site I linked to above, but, I have seen something like it done in e107, maybe its similar enough?<Br><Br>A guy modified a comic script found here - http://e107coders.org/  though, it didnt look like it was all that hard to code alone - in each portion of the table he had each individual day's html instead of the img, etc.  He had 5 copies of the comic script up, (he had 5 sections that would change each day...)  each named differently, so that e107 could differeniate them in the menu, and he'd include each on the main page (e107 uses a template style to edit, I dont know about PostNuke) but ya, the script was already set up to archive, because each day would just be one more then the day before.  Anyway, if I read what you wrote right, this seems like it would work, atleast in e107, though its definitely a work around.  I'll try to find the site... and as an extra note, in case it helps, heres the url to the comic script, I think - http://e107coders.org/download.php?view.172<Br><Br>And if I totally misunderstood, please dont hate me.
1073785978``xComment``xMinix``xa``xminix@westmercuryx.com``xps. I like the design.
1073796344``xComment``xOliver``xa``x``xThanks =)<Br><Br>I'm not sure if I understand you fully... are you saying he basically had 5 installs of e107?<Br><Br>Anyways, I think we may just treat all the articles the same... I'll have to talk to the other guys about that.  Either that, or I can code a bit to make a work-around... which I guess is possible, I'm just a little lazy. =)
1073796424``xComment``xOliver``xa``x``xActually, it doesn't seem like he installed 5 copies of e107, I misread your post.  What exactly did the comic script do, and what did e107 do with the scripts?  Was e107 doing the archiving or the comic script?
