1080927471``xComment``xOchs``xa``x``xYES! I knew I had heard those somewhere! The bottle one still cracks me up. Have you read bloodninja'a? haha.. those are funny.. and i almost got kicked out of pcl for laughing too hard on this one about a guy forgetting to pick up his daughter from soccer practice. I am glad more people appreciate this stuff. Seems like most people I show it to think it is dumb! lol which it is.. but that is what makes it fun!
