1074256392``xComing Home Soon``xVan``xa``xnguyen_van@mail.utexas.edu``xWell, I'm not sure how to get in contact with all of you back there half way around the world so I guess the best way is through O-web. Right now I'm at an internet cafe with my cousin in Saigon, Vietnam local time is 7:30 PM. Wow...a month in VN has been quite an experience...meeting my grandmothers...slew of aunts, uncles, cousins...shopping like mad! So you have a new dog over the break eh Oliver-boy? I kinda have a fiance now. Hehe. Tons of stories to tell..If I don't get SARS, malaria, or the chicken flu then I'll see all of you next semester!<Br><Br>Van
