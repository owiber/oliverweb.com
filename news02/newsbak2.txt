Deep Conversations``xOliver``xSam, Andrew, and I (with some input from a few others) were talking about "deep" stuff the other day and I've decided to post about it a bit.  We arrived at the conclusion that pain existed in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:16 - "I will greatly increase your pains in childbearing...") and that pain/suffering is required in a relationship in order to grow (perhaps past a certain "line").  So pretty much, the main question is... what of pain/suffering in heaven?<br><br>According to Revelations (something, too lazy to look it up) and probably some other passages, there will no longer be any pain/suffering in heaven.  What of relationships then?  Do they become stagnant at that point and/or are these questions irrelevant since we can't comprehend heaven and our lives there?<br><br>I think we also talked about the why there is suffering and if it is a direct consequence of sin.  If so, why was there pain/suffering in Garden of Eden?  Because of Lucifer's sin?  I guess this also brings up the question... were Adam & Eve sinless before eating the fruit?  Or "merely" ignorant of their sins?<br><br>I'm not sure if I'm transcribing the ideas we talked about accurately or not... but hey, interesting nonetheless. =)``xEpAuAuZkFAcxWJqJKd``x1094943639``x(default)
Good Old EE``xOliver``xBoy I love my EE class. It's so exciting! Actually... no.<br><br>At the moment, I'm in the back of the class typing away on my Powerbook while listening to my iPod.  I have no clue what the professor is saying and I've totally tuned him out.  My phone started ringing though, and that's bad cause today I forgot to silence it.<br><br>This guy is really boring, I think I do better just looking at the book. Lunch with sister today. Oh boy oh boy! lol, j/k j/k... ;)``xEpAulFlpAVqaHxOcXs``x1094834495``x(default)
Oops``xOliver``xI wrote something about my boring EE professor and some other cooking stuff, but I lost it cause I pressed CMD+Q too many times. Argh. =)  Oh well... I'm in linguistics right now talking about the wonderful world of morphemes! YAY!``xEpAuyyZFZAXyxwvcqV``x1094663779``x(default)
No mas Chinese!``xOliver``xChinese is absolutely brutal.  As a result, Chad and I have both dropped it and signed up for Intro to Buddhism (well, that's the plan at least... not official as of yet).  This is all thanks to the new <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/ug04-06/index.html">2004-2006 Catalog</a>. w00tness!<br><br>Someone needs to pay our rent (and by pay, I mean pick up the checks already written and drop them off at the office).  Anyone at home? =)``xEpAupVlAVlxmzCMGux``x1094055358``x(default)
Wheeeee``xOliver``xPoor OliverWEB has been neglected again.  People still need to send me stuff for <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/friends2004>Friends 2004</a>. =) <br><br>Apartment is a blast, I'm (kinda) cooking! I think Chinese is going to be the most brutal class of this semester for me, but hopefully not too brutal. =)  My EE prof is insanely boring, but I think I can live with it.<br><br>Uh oh, gotta take off for Game Dev.

Java Joseph``xOliver``xThis blog is dedicated to Andrew, known infamously throughout Sun as the "Java Sucks" intern.  For a brief moment, Andrew's hate for Java trickled throughout the vast internet and was aggregated by blog aggregators (like <a href=http://www.planetsun.org>PlanetSun</a>).<br><center><a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/javajoseph.png><img src=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/javajoseph.png width=349 height=275></a></center><br>That is, until Sun's Big Brother caught him and now Andrew is known as Java Joseph.``xEpAEuZZpyFCikSEroN``x1091473463``x(default)
More Apple``xOliver``xSo, I've gotten more used to the CMD+W/CMD+Q thing.  Here's my experience with the browsers:<br><br><b><a href=http://www.apple.com/safari/>Safari</a></b><blockquote><b>Good:</b> Nice integration with OS (ie. FTP links open in Finder, allowing easy download of folders, multiple files, etc.). <br><b>Bad:</b> Slow w/Gmail.</blockquote><br><b><a href=http://www.mozilla.org/products/camino/>Camino</a></b><blockquote><b>Good:</b> I like the way the tabs look. Haha.<br><b>Bad:</b> Nothing that really stands out... seems to load slightly slower than Safari.</blockquote><br><b><a href=http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/>Firefox</a></b><blockquote><b>Good:</b> Extensions rock. =) Just good 'ole Firefox.<br><b>Bad:</b> CMD+M is b0rk3d, it loads Mail instead of minimizing.</blockquote><br>For now, I've been using Camino... but I have all three in my dock and I change pretty frequently. =)<br><br>Some of OS X's "just works" stuff is kinda nice.  It's nice that they give you (for the most part) nice defaults that most people would want... however, it freakin' ticks me off when you can't change those defaults.  For example, when you plug in an external monitor, it automatically extends the desktop.  Okay, that's good. I like that.  However, what happens when I don't want to use the laptop LCD and I <i>just</i> want the PB to use the external monitor (with the laptop LCD open to use keyboard, touchpad)?... that's right, I can't do it (without some hacking, at least). So anyways, the best I can do for now is to mirror the display, but then I'm stuck at 1024x768 on the external monitor. Ugh.<br><br>Anyone know how to set your own profile in iChat? Yeah, I can't figure that one out yet.<br><br>My CPU temps hit 66.8C today while compiling KDE.  I flipped the PB on its side now (bottom of PB is perpendicular to table)... it cooled down to <65C... heh.<br><br>I had a big experience of inadequacy when it came to free "native" (as in, not using gFTP or something through X11) FTP clients for OS X.  So much so, that I started to look into writing my own.  I found that UT gave us Fetch for "free" (w/Bevoware) though, so I've played around with that and it seems like it would do the job.  Perhaps I'll write my own eventually anyways though, might be a nice little project to undertake. <br><br>Hmmm... oh, I LOVE <a href=http://synergy2.sourceforge.net>Synergy</a>.``xEpAEFAZVllsJKwNIMA``x1091393988``x(default)
P-P-P-Power HOT!``xOliver``xMax temps:<br><br>CPU: 65C/149F<br>GPU: 65C/149F<br>HDD: 49.8C/121.64F (it used to max at around 47.8ish I think)<br><br>Yeah, I don't like having this thing on my lap when I'm compiling large projects. lol``xEpAEkkEyVAmnvyJKdP``x1091218059``x(default)
Apple... stuff``xOliver``xAlright... so the new HD is in and boot time and application launching is faster.  I still don't have that "snappy" feeling to the UI though. *shrug* Guess that's what happens when you have a power-hungry eye-candy-filled GUI.  I think the G5's have that "snappy" feeling... but I guess my 1.33 G4 is far from a dual G5. =)<br><br>I need to find a good graphical FTP client.  I tried one out, but I got frustrated with it cause it was screwing stuff up so I just went over to my A64 box and did what I needed there.  <a href=http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/fugu/>Fugu</a> is supposedly pretty good, but it only supports SFTP and not regular FTP... at least, that's what I can gather.<br><br>I did this when I first got the PB, but after the reinstall, I forgot and it took me freakin' forever to figure it out again.  In .vimrc, do this to fix delete key:<br><br>set t_kb=^?<br>fixdel<br><br>Where ^? is CTRL+V+DELETE.  I wish Apple set their vim defaults to something nice by default like virtually every Linux distro out there.<br><br>Oh yeah, if you format the iPod for Windows, you can use it on both Windows and OS X as both an iPod and removable hard drive.  Hmmmmm... what else... I haven't made too much use of Expose yet, so I won't say much about that yet.  The CMD+W, CMD+Q thing still bugs me a little, but I'm slowly getting more used to it.<br><br>I'd say my iPod experience has been more enjoyable than my PB experience thus far, but I definately need to get used to some of this stuff (*cough*FREAKING ONE BUTTON*cough*).  Thank goodness for <a href=http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/20854>SideTrack</a> or I would be really really not liking this.  Default touchpad speed and acceleration is also a bit slow, Sidetrack fixed that for me too.  Right now I have the tap on the touchpad being the right click, which is working okay for me.<br><br>I like how Safari opens FTP sites in Finder, but it doesn't seem to like Gmail very much and waddles through that much slower than Camino or FireFox.  I made Camino my default browser for now...<br><br>iChat is kinda fruity, so I made it even fruitier... that's the only way I can use.  The bubbles are kinda growing on me, I blame Brook for this one.  Terminal is the lame.  I very quickly replaced it with iTerm.  However, there is a "make delete send backspace" option in Terminal which is nice (this makes the above t_kb thing in .vimrc unnecessary).<br><br>Hmmmm, let's see... what else... oh yeah, Chad, you can turn on the ability to tab through alert buttons and stuff in System Preferences->Keyboard & Mouse->Keyboard Shortcuts->Turn on full keyboard access.  I don't know why this isn't on by default... oh well, at least it's there.<br><br>Alright, well I've got a ton more stuff to play with, so I'm off! =)``xEpAEEyVkVpSlbOMKlA``x1091161650``x(default)
Tomorrow!``xOliver``xThe 7200RPM drive comes in.  W000 w00!!!<br><br>I have noticed that the PB doesn't get very good wireless signal compared to my Dell... I wonder why... couldn't they just attach the antenna to the all alluminum chassis??``xEpApAZVklVIBLBPNNb``x1090971685``x(default)

FOOD FOR THE PB``xOliver``xToday, I am going to buy some more RAM for my PB.  It is disturbingly slow at the moment swapping like crazy with the slow 4200RPM drive right now.  It is almost unbearable, especially compared to my new A64 3200+, the Pentium-M 1.7GHz, and P4 2.8GHz workstation I've been used to for the past few weeks. Actually, it is unbearable... but I am getting through it by telling myself that I will be replacing the slow parts soon (hopefully).  Soo... I'll see how much an extra 512MB of RAM will help.<br><br><a href=http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?id=1064001118794&skuId=5958911&type=product&productCategoryId=cat01170&cmp=++>Kingston 512MB PC2700 DDR SoDIMM from BestBuy</a> - <a href=http://postpublisher.net/h/bestbuy/adhoc/200407/ESE/coupon2.htm?>10% </a> - <a href=http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?id=cat12105&type=page&rebateid=49234&skuid=5958911>$20 MIR</a> = ~$87 after tax.``xEpApyEVEZyttpzHqpy``x1090611576``x(default)
PB``xOliver``xI feel I must blog about my new PowerBook.  First, I will give you specs:<br><br>12" PB <br>1.33GHz<br>60GB 4200RPM hard drive<b>*</b><br>256MB RAM<b>*</b><br><br>Umm... yeah, that's about all, you can "guess" the rest.  I also got me a nice little 20GB iPod (new 4G one), but I have done little with it other than plug it into the wall and place it on top of a laundry bin. lol<br><br><b>*</b>I plan on replacing that hard drive with either a Toshiba 40GB 5400RPM 16MB cache one or a Hitachi Travelstar 40GB 7200RPM one.  I'm not quite sure which one to go with as of yet.  I could get a 60GB, but I doubt I'm going to be needing all that space (especially with the 20GB from the iPod) so I'd rather save the money.  Also, 512MB RAM from Crucial is in order...<br><br>As for the "Mac experience"... I don't really have too much to say as of yet, mostly because I haven't done that much.  VJ is a freakin' Smallville Nazi and if you even try to blink when you're "supposed" to be watching Smallville, he will attempt to rip your intestines out through your ribs. Which reminds me, VJ VJ VJ VJ VJ VJ VJ VJ VJ VJ.<br><br>So, I'm going to withhold comments on my "Mac experience" until I finish upgrading the little thing, but I will note that I managed to freeze it within a few hours of use and had to hold the power button thingy down to restart it. Booooooo. That's nothing compared to Andrew locking up a G5 in the Apple store though.  What can I say?  We're masters.``xEpApVkpFAkYbScgZHt``x1090516792``x(default)

Anyways, I still go here and to <a href=http://www.hardforum>[H]ard|Forum</a> a few times a week, just not daily.<br><br><a href=http://www.tech-report.com>The Tech Report</a> - TR's got some cool stuff occasionally... so I visit occasionally.<br><br><a href=http://www.kde-look.org>KDE-Look.org</a> - I'm still looking for a good KDE window decoration that isn't just a blatant rip of Aqua.

Friends 2004``xOliver``xSooooooo, I'm actually working on Friends 2004 this year... it's been a while, I think the last one was in 2001, so a lot has changed, it's crazy.  Anyways, I want to throw in a section that has a question submitted from each of you. Sooooo... think of a question and put it in the comments below.  Umm... try to keep it clean and don't make it a typical "what is your favorite book?" type of thing. =)``xEplVlZpFVkSXcdbNkS``x1085866752``x(default)
Happy Birthday, Van!``xOliver``xToday is Van's bday, happy birthday, Van. =)<br><br>I would also like to say that Day After Tomorrow was like Titanic + Independence Day + Twister all rolled into one and not as good as any of them.  It even had typical overused/done before scenes such as:<ul><li>Guy hanging from rope, cuts himself off, falls to his death to save friends that are holding on to him</li><li>Teenage Guy/Girl thing</li><li>Father/Son thing</li><li>Wolves.</li><li>Running away from monster thing</li></ul>Yeah, again, I would like to say that if this movie was being touted as "the movie the Republicans don't want you to see," by the Democrats then I'd have to say that the Republicans have much better taste than the Democrats. Either that, or the Democrats have a great sense of humor and failed miserably at conveying this film was intended as a comedy... oh, and the Republicans don't want you to see comedies.<br><br>However, there was a bit of good eye candy, and if you don't take the film seriously at all, it can be a good laugh.  I think it would have made a better comedy if they had just taken everything one step further.  For example, here are a few things they could have also thrown in that "the gang" came up with:<ul><li>At the end, we nuke the whole northern hemisphere, mutation goes insane and the dead frozen people in the north "wake up" --> X-Men vs Zombies time.</li><li>At the end, we see a lot of stereotypical people from foreign nations dance around and rejoice as we see the clouds vanish (think end of Independence Day)</li></ul>There's gotta be more things we came up with, but I can't remember them at the moment. There were also a few good jokes thrown in there every so often.  All in all, the movie really was just splices of a bunch of other movies, with blatantly blunt, stupid "in-your-face" attempts at political statements. Feel free to throw in more stuff in the comments. =)``xEplVlyApAkKOrDBnoa``x1085865492``x(default)
The View``xOliver``xWell, I just got back from getting a free coke at MTWKS, and I stopped to look out the window.

MTWKS``xOliver``xApparently, Motorola/Freescale's "abbreviation" for Metrowerks is MTWKS, which is just ridiculous.  Hehe... anyways, today at work, I saw two CDs on someone's desk that turned out to be the two gold CDs of CodeWarrior for embedded PPC linux. Pretty cool stuff, they were shortly picked up and sent out for mass production. It's really cool to be able to see works in progress and bleeding edge builds of a decently well known commercial product.<br><br>They also have an in-house Linux build of CodeWarrior... pretty nifty stuff. Can't get it anywhere else. =)<br><br>I'm going to copy/paste a little bit of an email I sent to Andrew: Oh yeah, Blizzard uses Metrowerks tools in their games, I saw a poster of WarCraft III that just had the WC3 logo on the top, then it was signed by all the developers... I also saw a Prince of Persia 2 poster somewhere.... wonder if I can get my hands on a beta... =) <br><br>I hope I didn't give away any info I wasn't supposed to...``xEplVyFFllkhKnETqel``x1085630282``x(default)

For Yesterday``xOliver``xI should have written this yesterday, but as it is apparent (see previous post), I was lazy. =)<br><br>Andrew, Mark and I started the day at 6/7AM ramping up to compete in <a href=http://ipsc.ksp.sk/>IPSC</a>.  I don't care how nerdy/geeky/weird that makes us, but we all had a pretty fun time I think.  Those darn Russians and Chinese middle schoolers. Cheaters! Haha. =)<br><br>We managed to get 4 points which put us right around the 50% mark compared to all the other teams.  If we had played a bit smarter, I'm pretty sure we could have broken 8 points, putting us at around the top 100 (winning team got 19 out of a max of 24... there were probably around 500 - 600 teams).  Oh well, there's always next year.<br><br>I don't really feel like doing a top whatever list for this past year, but definately major shout-outs go Sam and the little fishies he brought along (that'd be Paul and Nathan =).  Definately glad I chose to room with you Sam and getting to you know (corrupting? =) you guys better has been really really cool. Global domination begins behind the Target in August '04. lol``xEplVkpZlFVJfbnVhva``x1085204235``x(default)
Ahh...``xOliver``xA semester is over, GPA went up... ahhhh, I'm so relieved. I have stuff to talk about, but I've just become really lazy. Maybe later. =)``xEplVEluEyVfuHnvTjN``x1085180565``x(default)
Move Out Time!``xOliver``xAfter my test is done at 5, Sam and I are going into full scale move out mode.  Anyone who has stuff left in our room has until 7PM today to claim it, otherwise we do as we please. =)<br><br>WHHHHEEEEE... I can't wait until my test is over... I almost don't even care about my final grade in the class anymore... lol``xEpluApkyVpcqzFvpeV``x1084899050``x(default)
It is Done!... almost``xOliver``xWHEEEEEEE!!! No more classes! Now let's have a bit of fun before finals cram time. =)<br><br>RS:RV? =)``xEplFAZpuFZVFWqGSJK``x1083966837``x(default)
Busy Week``xOliver``xArgh, this week is going to be pretty yucky starting tomorrow.  I've got an EE test on Wednesday and an Online Game Tech program due on Thurs (might use one late day on that though to make it Fri)... argh, then I gotta work with my Chinese partner to write our skit show. Uber yucky.<br><br>I'm kinda anxious for this semester to end now... it started off alright, but it seems like all my classes converge every once in a while to make a really hectic week, and those tire me out -- I just want to finish and move on to the next semester.  A new set of topics and teachers, please. =)<br><br>Also pretty excited about getting the apartment next year, should be lots of fun, can't wait until moving in day. =)``xEplEluFupVRPopMPKO``x1081839805``x(default)
AOE2``xOliver``xToday marks the day when Van and I conquered Mark three times in a row in AOE2. Nevermind that he's got a gimp hand and it was 2v1, of course. =) CHHHH HAAAHH.``xEplEkkuppyapQxIMae``x1081220406``x(default)
It's April Fool's``xOliver``xWeeeeee. So... I beat 1:08:500 in Baby Park a few days ago... pass/failed two of my classes and should currently be studying for my Chinese quiz "tomorrow" but I'm really really not feeling like it. =)<br><br>OMan just turned 21! It's kinda weird watching everyone hit the big 21, I always saw the 20's as being so far away, I don't feel it at all. Heck, I only have one more year left of school! AAAAAHHHHHH!!<br><br>I need to find something I can consistantly talk about on OWeb... I find it difficult to come up with stuff sometimes.<br><br>Hmmm...``xEplplEykApzqgTgZUp``x1080823490``x(default)
Baby Park``xOliver``xToday I beat 1:10 on Baby Park.  This was probably the most productive day of my Spring Break.``xEpZAlFylkVynqkUSHJ``x1079844025``x(default)
Oliver & Andrew Will Rulz0rz QED``xOliver``xDrewser2001: oliver, should we spend spring break inventing a time machine, that way we'll always have enough time for everything<br>Owiber: yes, that is true<br>Owiber: but what if we don't succeed?<br>Owiber: this is like living your life assuming you'll create a time machine later<br>Owiber: lol<br>Drewser2001: yeah, exciting isn't it<br>Drewser2001: living on the edge<br>Owiber: hmmm<br>Owiber: so I could kill you, and assume I'll create a time machine in jail....<br>Drewser2001: yes, but that's considering I haven't created one in the future and stopped you from killing me<br>Owiber: oh... I see...<br>Owiber: but how would you do that if you were dead?<br>Owiber: what would have to happen is...<br>Owiber: I'd kill you, then later make a time machine to stop myself<br>Owiber: allowing you to make a time machine to go back to stop me also<br>Owiber: so both of us will be stopping me...<br>Owiber: that doesn't bode too well for me killing you<br>Owiber: lol<br>Drewser2001: interesting, I think it's better if we work together and rule the world as one<br>Owiber: yeah<br>Owiber: but I can still try to kill you since it wouldn't do anything anyways<br>Owiber: lol<br>Drewser2001: but what if we fail with our time machine<br>Drewser2001: then'll i just be dead, and you'll be in jail forever<br>Owiber: but... that's contradictory to our assumption!<br>Owiber: that really ruins everything then<br>Drewser2001: oh yeah, we must succeed then<br>Owiber: yeah<br>Drewser2001: ok, so you write the program and I'll design the hardware<br>Owiber: think we need a physicist?<br>Drewser2001: for sure, that would important as we try to defy every natural law there is<br>Owiber: hmm...<br>Owiber: do you know a physicist?<br>Owiber: oh, I know what we can do<br>Owiber: assume we create a time machine and talk to Einstein about creating the time machine<br>Drewser2001: we can go to the future and find a better physicist that knows almost everything about time travel too<br>Owiber: oh, yeah<br>Drewser2001: wow, that'd make our lives easier<br>Owiber: we can create a time machine, then go into the future and steal the plans from ourselves<br>Owiber: perfect!<br>Drewser2001: yeah!!!<br>Owiber: and if we need money, we can go into the future and beg for change... once we get back, reverse inflation will make us rich<br>Drewser2001: we're brilliant<br>Owiber: oh man, this is awesome<br>Drewser2001: that it is<br>Drewser2001: we can't be stopped ``xEpZAFkZEFZibgyJKvG``x1079334337``x(default)

Lab Hours``xOliver``xWell, I'm in lab hours for another almost two hours so I'm really really bored. I guess I might start on a CS project soon because there are absolutely no CS307 students in the lab right now (there isn't even a CS307 assignment due this week).<br><br>Anyways, was looking at the Upcoming Movies on <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/">RT</a> and it looks pretty exciting:<ul><li>Spider-Man 2<br><li>Kill Bill: Volume 2<br><li>The Passion of the Christ<br><li>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban<br><li>Jersey Girl</ul><br>Weeeee!<br><br>Wo de benzi qu shangdian porque Dezhou he cha.

3:20AM``xOliver``xPaul and I are sitting in my dorm right now and Sam is taking a girl home (ooooOoOoOoOhhh Saaammm... ;).  We just finished a great midnight/early morning feast at San Jacinto.  We had apple pie, pumpkin pie, honey mesquite chicken, milk, Dr.Pepper, whipped cream, and... uhh.. yeah, it was a lot of fun. Richie even brought down Mr.Hedgehog.<br><br>K, I need to go home now. Tata!``xEpZyEuVylVjScDgAiO``x1076152885``x(default)
Mark is at the door``xOliver``x...and Chad is letting him in.  Chinese is A LOT OF WORK.<br><br>K, that's all for now.``xEpZypuEVEkyXNpKava``x1076048712``x(default)
1:40AM Post``xOliver``xLike the title suggests, I'm making (well, starting at least) this post at 1:40AM. Weee. I just watched a bunch of trailers on Apple's site and now I'm in a mode of "deep contemplation." The only thing is that I'm not sure what I'm contemplating about. =)  <br><br>Hmm... anyways, saw the Jersey Girl trailer again and thought that that looks like another movie you'd go to on a date.  Well, that lead me to Kevin Smith's <a href=http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/jerseygirl/>online diary</a> on it and it seems like he thinks it's the best movie he's every made (although very different from his other movies). *shrug* Also found some movie that Stupid Blond Girl From 24 is in and... uhh... as VJ would put it, it looked pretty squirty. I love how that can mean both something really good and something really bad... and I'm not even going to clarify, so it'll be left as vague as ever.<br><br>School's not too bad yet, although I see the horrible onslaught of Chinese + multiple CS projects + tests + extracurricular activities + work eventually hammering at my head and state of "sanity."  So far, I've just got Chinese and Liquid website stuff... and that's not too bad.<br><br>It's always quiet in the room with just Sam and I.  We both have headphones on and are on our computers.  Samitucus or Samiticus, which spelling do you guys like better?<br><br>Uhhh... bathroom time.``xEpZVkZyEluPyzbjdiV``x1075283384``x(default)
Answering Machine``xOliver``xNathan and I have just deduced that the answering machine in our room is busted.  We need a new phone, this one is stupid.  So anyways, if you've left a message, we never got it.<br><br>Oh yeah, Nathan and I changed the answering machine message... it's hip and cool and hop... dude.``xEpZVpyuuplZxADPphe``x1075071608``x(default)
Ani``xOliver``xToday is The Return of Van!``xEpZuVEkZVZgnfKrqmk``x1074519957``x(default)
Liquid Website``xOliver``xWell, I've been working on the Liquid website a lot recently and I noticed that I have built up a lot of icons on my desktop.  So... I'm uploading <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/liquidwork.jpg>a pic</a> just for fun. =) Uhh... the ochs.png is not liquid-related, but everything else is.  <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/ochs.png>That PNG</a> is just funny. ;)``xEpZuFZkpyVdSBoOpJh``x1074379265``x(default)
Moulin Rouge``xOliver``xJust got back watching Moulin Rouge for my first time with some guys over at Liquid.  Pretty good movie... I liked the way they mixed the songs together... it was sad though. =(  Although, the only thing about watching movies like this is that I feel like I should have watched them with a girlfriend.  Oh well, I can console myself with the fact that Brook and Grant saw it together when it first came out. =)<br><br>No more Double Dash for Nancy for a while, I'm done!``xEpZupZEyFyKTlXJtzE``x1074078836``x(default)
Stufffffff``xOliver``xWell, it's 5AM right now and I should be sleeping soon.  Origon (or however you spell his name =) is sleeping on my bed and he's snoring.  It's kinda funny.<br><br>Was looking at trailers and noticed that Passion (now named The Passion of the Christ?) is coming out February 25th.  I'm looking forward to seeing that.<br><br>Ummm... k, that's it for now. I'm supposed to have a meeting with Karen about Liquid website "tomorrow" (later today), so I really should be sleeping.  Night!``xEpZFAAEAFZCNEfgSTe``x1073999137``x(default)
CMS Crazy``xOliver``xSo, I spent most of the day going through tons of <a href=http://www.opensourcecms.com/>CMS's</a> (thanks to Minix for link).  I think it's driving me crazy... but I think I may try e107 or PostNuke for the Liquid site.  Tried installing Tiki, but the Liquid server was being stupid and I couldn't upload the whole thing... so maybe I'll wait to try that one. I need to have a meeting with Karen sometime to finalize and/or redo the <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/designs/liquid/04>Liquid layout</a>.<br><br>Hmm... also found out that I apparently changed my CHI506 class.  I have no clue when I did that, cause I thought I was in the earlier class as well.  Oh well... we'll see what happens. =)``xEpZFlAlyFkEdDypDkr``x1073905832``x(default)
It's 5:21AM``xOliver``x... and I'm still up working on Liquid website and playing with various content management systems... uploading PostNuke right now.<br><br>Sleep?... maybe.``xEpZFZFFyZAjkULjqWg``x1073740879``x(default)
Canine Pics``xOliver``xSo... I uploaded some dog pictures to the <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/albums>Picture Album</a>. Specifically, our new dog is <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/albums/?mode=view&album=Dogs%21&pic=IM004240.jpg&dispsize=800&start=0#albumtop>here</a> and <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/albums/?mode=view&album=Dogs%21&pic=IM004241.jpg&dispsize=800&start=0#albumtop>here</a>.``xEpZFFuZlZuJikegixI``x1073355074``x(default)
New Dog``xOliver``xSo we got a new dog today and found out Orbit had a minor tumor on his tail that needs to be removed (which will be done by tomorrow morning I believe).  I'll get up pictures sometime... Oriana originally wanted to name the new dog Oink, but after seeing it... he doesn't really look like an Oink, so the name's in the air (although, it probably must start with the expected 'O' letter).  I suggest Orc Muncher or Orc Crusher.  I'm leaning towards Orc Muncher now... but the final decision's up to Oriana. =)``xEpZFFuylkECpUMdeme``x1073354021``x(default)
NY/NYE Pics``xOliver``xNathan's got NY/NYE pics online over at his <a href=http://www.pbase.com/nathantsui/new_year_04>PBase</a>.  I'll upload them to OliverWEB eventually.``xEpZFkApuZAWXxzyhRY``x1073297679``x(default)

TI Emulator``xOliver``xWell, I just IM'ed Chad with this... but I'll go ahead and make a post about it too cause I seem to remember a few people being interested in it (Van? Andrew? I forget exactly who).  Anyways, I found a nifty TI emulator with images of the TI calculators too... I had to grab the ROMs off of another site (I'm guessing it's not all that legal to host the ROM images?)... but I got them and threw them into the emulator's ZIP file which I've uploaded <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/vti.zip>here</a>. Please don't report me to TI.<br><br>Ahem... to TI: I own a TI83 and have uploaded the ROM image to my website for backup purposes only. Please ignore the TI86.ROM file. Thanks. ;)``xEpZFEyFlEAMApLbjLb``x1073171019``x(default)
Whoa``xOliver``xWho modified <a href=http://www.jw152.com>JW152</a>? Sam? Nathan?``xEpZFEVlpppAtNVwBiX``x1073165200``x(default)
Creature Tech``xOliver``xYesterday, Chad, Oriana and I went over to Dragon's Lair (Round Rock) while waiting for Nathan to get off work.  Chad bought a comic called Creature Tech which is pretty cool. The art and story and stuff is by Doug Tennapel who did Earthworm Jim and some FIF CD art... among other stuff.  Yeah, anyways... the art and story is pretty nifty so you guys should ask Chad to read it if you're interested.  Unless if he's paranoid you'll ruin it... which is likely. =P Heh, j/k.<br><br>I bought issue #2, #3, and #4 of Superman/Batman comics which seem pretty entertaining as well.  Ordered #1 off of eBay as a bunch of places are selling out of it.<br><br>Umm.. yeah... so finally, LAN party at Nathan's tonight. GO GO GO!``xEpZkApkuEVWjuDqREG``x1072909615``x(default)
Designing OWeb``xOliver``x<a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/designs/oweb04>Here</a>, you can find a mockup and some "under construction" shots of the new design... at least look at my <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/designs/oweb04/mockup.png>initial mockup</a> I showed Nathan and Sam... it's cool. ;)``xEpZkZFyyZZRLfWehSq``x1072743877``x(default)
l337 5p34k!!``xOliver``xThe pics to the left now link to the larger versions... so you can "zoom" in on the small images.  Once it starts repeating, it stops linking though... there are only 13 pics, then it starts tiling.``xEpZkylVVVZxOIqOXPK``x1072692757``x(default)
More Updates``xOliver``xAdded a few picture links to misc. section... uploaded pics from my family's Florida vacation and misc. pics from around the dorm, Matrix Revolutions, and other places to the <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/album/>Picture Album</a>. w00t!``xEpZkylEuEygzmCOyOF``x1072688616``x(default)
Wheee!!!``xOliver``xWell, I finally did it. I updated OliverWEB, including a new layout! (as you can probably tell =).<br><br>w00t!<br><br>K, well, hopefully I'll update more from now on too... LAN party at Nathan's NYE/NY, don't forget!``xEpZkyZVyAkGpKImJyz``x1072682892``x(default)
Late Night Googling``xOliver``xNot sure if this <a href=http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/51442.html>was me</a>, but that's kinda wierd. I don't remember that.<br><br><a href=http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=markbrandt>Mark lives in Illinois</a>.<br><br>Dunno what this means, but they want to know <a href=http://www.4x4wire.com/lists/jeepoffroad/200208/msg00000.html>where Chad is</a>.<br><br>There are way too many Van Nguyens, and Nancy has a <a href=http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Acres/9288/candy.html>Candy Candy</a> website.<br><br>Nathan has an <a href=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/recognition/2429.html>INSANE amount</a> of stuff on GameFaqs... what a nerd. haha ;) (hey, this one's real too)<br><br>... oooohhh...

Another Server Move``xOliver``xWell, I moved it again. The only things that I lost were some comments about JW152.com and Harisu or something like that.  No biggie. =)<br><br>K... now... on to Liquid-ACC.com, then I might start OWeb redesign. *sigh* Too much stuff!``xEpyVFZZFyVvusHaxsv``x1065384565``x(default)
Class and Stuff``xOliver``xWell, I've got a decent amount of web-stuff to do... which is taking a decent amount of my time, but oh well. =)<br><br>My classes seem pretty cool... Computer Networks - we're doing some neat stuff with actual real examples (ie. something called the Internet). Computer Graphics - OpenGL time!  Computer Architecture - the prof. worked at IBM and now at Intel... he helped with the G5 core and the maybe-soon-to-be Pentium 5.  Pretty neat.  Comp Arch looks like it'll be pretty fun too, it's the class I'm looking forward to the most.``xEpykEFZFluyqjyrCkA``x1062144584``x(default)

Gentooops``xOliver``xuhhh... so I was compiling KDE and OpenOffice.org-Ximian at the same time and I managed to use over 2GB up in the compilation of the two of those, which resulted in me using up 100% of that partition. Oops.  Time for # parted /dev/hda.<br><br>In contrast, my 7GB partition for /home is using less than 4% of that allocated space.  I think I know where to put some of that extra space....``xEpypVFVlFujnaiDJPC``x1060543034``x(default)
Gentoo!``xOliver``xGentoo is up and running! I've got a lot to configure though, like various power saving stuff, suspend, etc. etc.  I think I just got my audio working and started compiling stuff... at the moment, apache, php, samba, and grip are compiling, so I decided I should probably let those finish before I compile anymore. =)<br><br>Ooohh! Samba finished! bbl``xEpypuZluElwoPOjUSx``x1060485618``x(default)
GIMP``xOliver``xAfter a long while of abstaining from using GIMP because of it's horrible (well, IMHO) UI compared to Photoshop (okay, maybe that's just because I'm used to PS now)... I took a stab at 1.3.17 (the latest devel version), and I must say, I am VERY VERY impressed by how much they've improved it.<br><br>Now, they have a menu bar above the image, as well as the crazy right click menu, which is very helpful because I hated that right click thing (again, probably just used to Photoshop).  It didn't import my PSD's very nicely, but that's alright, just would have been a nice perk.  There are a few nice things missing (ie. preview on a lot of the filters/script-fu's) but it definately is getting there.<br><br>I'd say give it another few months and I may begin trying to use it instead of Photoshop for my designs.  GOOOOO (legally =) FREE SOFTWARE!``xEpyppykkkFOQnzggNP``x1060069423``x(default)

I'm glad I was able to use those points for something of worth. =)<br><br>I always thought that Queen did the music for Transformers... but it doesn't look like they did...``xEpVAVAEVFEVZAxNjxz``x1059598731``x(default)

ZZZZZZzzzzzz``xOliver``xSo, I was going to spam one of Nancy's Xanga posts more, but then I realized that I have a website! Heh... so, I am throwing this up instead of adding a lot more comments elsewhere... although I may still do that if I'm bored. =)<br><br>For some reason, I feel very sleepy today... I got at least 7 hours of sleep and accidently woke up late (which resulted in me just jumping out of bed, throwing my hat on, and rushing to work =)... so I'm not sure why I feel so tired.  I think I'm going to go home for lunch and take a shower, I feel nasty.<br><br>I would like to reaffirm that my car's name <i>is</i> still Asif, despite many negative reactions from Ms.K, her sister, and Co..  Also, someone remind me to show Andrew the astronaut picture thing... although, I think I might have lost it again. Nah, it's probably on my desk somewhere...

Wow``xOliver``xMan, I've been busy!  I'd just like to point out that Nancy is <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/stuff/badnancy.jpg>evil</a>. Liquid-Missions, work, Physics, and other misc. stuff have been keeping me quite busy.  SMS messaging Tim who is all the way in India is pretty cool, I think I may change my phone plan to allow for more of those (and perhaps MMS's too)!<br><br>My new laptop is sweeeeet! =)  Like in my aim profile at the moment, here are a few 'specs': <a href="http://www.knoppix.net">Knoppix</a> installed <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> on <a href="http://www.vmware.com">VMWare</a> 4 Workstation on <a href="http://www.dell.com">Dell</a> Latitude D400 (P-M 1.7GHz, 512MB, 40GB 5400RPM) running <a href="http://fluxbox.sf.net">Fluxbox</a>.``xEpVZpFZAVEviwenGwq``x1057045151``x(default)
Skim Milk``xOliver``xI wanted some milk to go with the banana bread Oriana made (she's awesome! it's good stuff =)... but the only thing in the fridge was skim milk!!! That's MILK FLAVORED WATER! I hate that stuff.  So... to spite the whole "no fat" thing, I poured myself a glass, took out some half and half and drenched that thing with nice creamy fat.<br><br>Yum.``xEpVVVyyZpZTwEgyVCv``x1055573907``x(default)
Calculator``xOliver``xAnyone know where my TI-83 is?<br><br>On another note, Moto interns went to the Heart House in Austin today (it's a free after-school/summer daycare type thing for poor families) and my group made a bunch of folder games, it was crazy.  Our laminator machine liked to each up the plastic and jam, it was not fun getting it to work (although Tecuan was the one who mainly messed with it).<br><br>I have decided that as a result of Gentoo, I have become a bit more hardcore geek. Today, I found myself browsing two Gentoo IRC rooms, it was quite... nerdy. =)<br><br>I am anxious to get my new laptop... right after XP is done installing on that thing, it's Gentoo time! Although, I haven't decided if I want to boot up using Knoppix first to install Gentoo with... (if I did it that way, I could actually use the thing while Gentoo is installing...)``xEpVVkAlkEFpbzwEPlP``x1055305413``x(default)
Doobedoo``xOliver``xWell, I finally got something to code at Moto today, I was getting tired of reading documentation over and over again. However, I did learn a lot more about Gentoo, Python, and a few other things...<br><br>That's about it for now, I think I might go sleep.``xEpVulyulVZzjbzDxVu``x1054872057``x(default)
Project Grad``xOliver``xWell, I'm lazy, so I'm just going to copy what I said to Nancy:<br>Owiber: Andrew, Van and I went to proj grad for a little bit<br>Owiber: after a long time of trying to get in...<br>WithLuv01: i idn't know ya'll were allowed to go<br>WithLuv01: LOL<br>WithLuv01: how did ya'll get in?<br>Owiber: but we took Van against his will so he hates us now<br>Owiber: umm....<br>Owiber: well the first time we went, we asked them if we could say hi to teachers<br>Owiber: they eventually sent us away...<br>Owiber: then I called Olivia and she talked to Mr.Daniels and he came out to get us, except where we were going to meet... they made us leave before he got there<br>WithLuv01: argh<br>WithLuv01: complicated<br>Owiber: so.. we just went to the volunteer parking area and just told those guys that the other guys told us to park there =)<br>Owiber: then we just walked into the volunteer sign-in area and Andrew knew a tennis guy there, so they let us in<br>Owiber: but then Ms.Parker saw us and tried to kick us out but we got rescued by Balmer and Daniels<br>WithLuv01: LOL<br>WithLuv01: hahaha<br>WithLuv01: ya'll really wanted in<br>Owiber: yeah<br>Owiber: we wanted to say hi to Ms.Hengst, but she never showed up in the time we were tehre<br>Owiber: there*``xEpVuFVAEuujFHgZwrO``x1054366344``x(default)
Van face``xOliver``xUmm... so yeah.. I didn't realize it was the 29th until now... HAPPY BIRTHDAY, Van!!! =)``xEpVukVpklkUXZSwpcq``x1054257482``x(default)
Aye!``xOliver``xUgh... ACC + work is so tiring, even if the work itself isn't tough... I got home tonight and man... I feel drained. I even fell asleep in class for a while (which did give me a temporary boost).<br><br>So I just realized that I really should make another Friends page this summer... but I have so many other websites to do, I'll be lucky if I can get to that.  Hmm... well, if I get inspired, it'll happen... otherwise... =/``xEpVuElyEVpKrZnFTyw``x1054193350``x(default)
Sooo...``xOliver``xIf Andrew would give me a way to contact him back rather than leave a voice mail with no way to get back to him, that would be preferable. =)  My work phone is not operational yet.. but I *think* it will be: 996-4806... should be working Monday or Tuesday.  Email: oliverwong@motorola.com.<br><br>My cell may or may not work.``xEpVuEVVEVVwbplyLao``x1054162355``x(default)
Vim (Vi too?)``xOliver``xKnow how sometimes vim gets pesky and doesn't let you use the backspace to delete characters past where you entered insert mode? Here's the fix:<blockquote>set backspace=indent,eol,start</blockquote>There ya go! ;)<br><br>Edit: Only works for vim, haven't looked for the fix to vi and probably won't cause I don't care. =)``xEpVuEVEllulsMtGhiO``x1054159084``x(default)
Updates``xOliver``xIt's funny how I check OliverWEB to see if perhaps some updates were made when I know I haven't done anything. =)<br><br>I've been feeling a bit drained creativity-wise on things to talk about (err... as you can tell, for a while)... I'm not quite sure what happened.  I should like to have creative and fun things to talk about... hmmm...<br><br>However, I haven't been too drained graphics-design wise, which is thankful.  Now, I've got four websites in my "website queue" after finally finishing the <a href=http://www.youthwave.org>Youthwave</a> redesign. The liquid-missions, liquid (although Karen is handling most of the graphical design on that one), lighthouse, and John Mao's parents' restaurant. Hmmm... perhaps I'm going to overload myself. =/  An intern coordinater person at work asked me if I could make a website for her baby too... I'm not quite sure if I can handle all that...<br><br>On to work... well, first day flew by rather fast... some girls talked to Van and I about how they didn't recognize us at all even though they thought they knew everyone who interned last summer.  We realized that between Van, Tecuan, and I, we really did isolate ourselves from the rest of the interns... heh... oh well. =)<br><br>I actually was a bit productive today, got most of my accounts setup (except still need to find mail server name so  I don't have to use web interface) and learned quite a bit of python.  I believe my project this year is to help make a thin layer between one API to another... and perhaps make the thin layer go from C/C++ to Python.  I'm not entirely sure on the details, but it sounds interesting.<br><br>Well, that's all for today. Hope Andrew had a nice time on his first day at Sun too.  I know Van got stuck back into his old dept. Hehe... poor Van. ;)``xEpVuplVFyFyRsyuUrg``x1054092563``x(default)
Teaser Pics``xOliver``xHola! Well, we've uploaded four teaser photos for all of you to enjoy... you can find them <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/lazy/teaser>here</a>!``xEpVFyVypApgKgpEbaP``x1053663290``x(default)
Postcards``xOliver``xWe sent them out yesterday... so they may or may not beat us back. ;)  We may try to upload some teaser pics too... if we manage to survive the 56k (connected at 19.2k). =/<br><br>-Andrew, Mark, Oliver, and Viraj from Panama City, FL.``xEpVFyVuFFpjzGCKVYE``x1053661530``x(default)
Viraj``xOliver``xAlso, I would like to note that we are keeping track of what we call the "Viraj Vulgarity Level" on this trip.  For our first day, we recorded the number of times he said "cock"... it was about 70+.<br><br>We'll get back to you with a more accurate figure in a full trip report. =)``xEpVkAuZEEyfJZSLwJe``x1052954316``x(default)
Orlando``xOliver``xWe're in Orlando right now (specifically, a Starbucks using the T-Mobile HotSpot wireless stuff).<br><br>We got 10PM Matrix Reloaded tickets too =D. And the theater doesn't look like it's going to be too crowded either. (none of the shows were sold out)<br><br>Anyhow, we'll have pics and stories to tell eventually... including an encounter with a cop. ;)``xEpVkAuFVpuQmBPNxli``x1052950704``x(default)

Andrew's gonna hate me``xOliver``xWell, I figured at the end of the year, I would kick in Andrew's drawers for the last time... =)<br><br>However, I decided to make it <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/lazy/nancycam/p1270025.jpg>especially</a>   <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/pics/lazy/nancycam/p1270026.jpg>special</a> just for him. =)<br><br>Haha... I'm gonna be dead. =)``xEpVEAAupuFenWfUJwG``x1052001243``x(default)
Basement``xOliver``xWell, I'm sitting in the Taylor basement right now... skipping Automata Theory again (hope she doesn't hand out a quiz today   =).  I would have been out of here 30+ minutes ago, but some girl just sent 45+ jobs to the printer... so I have to wait for her to get done before mine reaches the end of the queue. Ugh.  Oh, and the other printer is dead... I tried printing to that one until I noticed that the job at the front of the queue had been sitting there for three hours. Ugh Ugh Ugh.<br><br>Hmm... well that's all for now. Maybe I will sneak into the end of Automata and see if she handed out a quiz....``xEpVEpuZpkkKtuQvSIx``x1051054222``x(default)

Debian``xOliver``xAhhh... my leap into the world of Debian. Turned out much better than I expected!  I installed using my Knoppix CD, which made the whole process much easier! The HD install script didn't allow me to specify different partitions for different mount points, so I did that after the install was finished. I made a seperate partition for /home so that in future installs, I wouldn't have to kill it.<br><br>I'm just going to throw a few notes here now:<br><br>Antialias in Phoenix (installed from <a href=http://pryan.org/phoenix/>here</a>):<ul><li>userChrome.css and userContent.css - make sure it uses Luxi Sans or another antialiased font</li></ul><br><br>Konsole AA fonts:<ul><li>Just grabbed a ton of fonts from baghat and threw them in /usr/share/fonts. This messed up the default sans font though and made it look really ugly.</li><li>To fix that... see <a href=http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=37347&highlight=antialias>this Gentoo thread</a>. Basically, turn off hinting for sans fonts.</li></ul><br><br>Let's see... oh yeah, dhclient:<ul><li>Wait time was too long originally for dhcp. So: "apt-get install dhcp-client" installs dhclient, which worked quite well.  Edit /etc/dhclient.conf and edit timeout value.</li></ul><br><br>Alright, I think that's all I want to say for now. =)``xEpVppFZEyuNFWdldtK``x1050044364``x(default)

Knoppix``xOliver``xSo I stumbled upon Knoppix again (I think Van tried them out a little a while back). And while I was chatting with Mark, he discovered this neat little tib-bit of info from <a href=http://www.knoppix.net>Knoppix.net</a>:<blockquote><i>Knoppix 3.2 has now KDE 3.1 and "persistant home" - a way to save the configuration also on hd and USB-Memory-Sticks.</i></blockquote>So, I had this idea... you get one of <a href=http://www.meritline.com/minidvdr.html>these</a>, and one of <a href="http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProduct.asp?submit=manufactory&catalog=68&manufactory=1785&DEPA=1">these</a>, and you've got a really really awesome mobile custom OS in your pocket(s). Oh man, I'm not sure how, when or if I'll actually use it but the prospect of actually doing it is so cool I'm so very tempted........``xEpuZVlkpAFCTgwkUNW``x1047589293``x(default)

Just wanted to add a bit of excitement to your party. ;)<br><br>On another note, I got the following email from Blizzard:<blockquote><i>Welcome to the Warcraft(R) III: The Frozen Throne(TM) Battle.net(R) Beta Program<br><br>You made it!

Xanga``xOliver``xI just read <a href=http://www.xanga.com/pancy>Nancy's Xanga</a> while in CS341, and I feel sorry for her and her pharmacy woes. So I made something in Linux GIMP with my touchpad for her.<br><br>The following is a flower in a medicine bottle for Nancy. And while I was at it, I threw in a Daredevil for Chad, a new hat for Mark, a ginseng root (haha! =) for Andrew, the C&C:Generals honorable medal for Brook (I don't remember what it looked like, so my picture is just a yellow thing), and some smelly green fuming poop for Van. I didn't know what to give Megan, so she gets a lolipop.

Monkeys, Love, Heart, Flower``xOliver``xI haven't posted anything in a while. I'm sitting in CS341 right now, Automata Theory. I should probably be listening to the professor, but I'm not. I took a Programming Languages test yesterday and I believe I did well on that... except for perhaps 1/2 or 1/3 of a problem. *shrug* If he takes off 12 (was it 12?) points for that again, here comes the BOOM.<br><br>K, goodbye.``xEpuVZZllAAdlkEVpnD``x1045786099``x(default)

Tolkien``xOliver``xMan, J.R.R. has to be one of the coolest dudes ever. I'm only half-way through LOTR, but I like it a lot. He just has a way of putting certain things into words (and by "words" I also mean the ones he made up =) to make it sound <i>cool</i>. I was talking to Mark and concluded that I would have very much liked to have hung out with Lewis and Tolkien (btw, what's with the initials? J.R.R, C.S.?) and smoked pipe with them in Oxford... even though that's probably what ended their lives.<br><br><i>Mithrander</i>... man, that's just so COOL. I don't know why I like it so much, but I think Tolkien's languages are really really spiffy. I, for one, would have no objection to this guy actually creating a real language for people to speak... it'd be the language of coolness. =)<br><blockquote><i>Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,<br>Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,<br>Nine for the Mortal Men doomed to die,<br>One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne<br>In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.<br>One Ring to Rule them all, One Ring to find them,<br>One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them<br>In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.</i></blockquote><br>Argh, so cool!<br><br>I've decided my son's name is going to be Mithrandir...<br><br>Okay, fine... maybe just his middle name. ;)``xEpuFZpyFEFQxCOZkah``x1043713513``x(default)

Trickery``xOliver``xHAHA... I just wanted to write this down so it is recorded and I can remember it in days to come. =)  "Andrew" just played a FFA Warcraft 3 game versus Mark and Van... the tricky thing was, it actually wasn't Andrew, it was me. =) AND, it was unknown that it was me and I even tried to play like Andrew in the beginning to throw Mark off. Hehe. =)<br><br>Also, I made a "truce" with Mark knowing he thought it was Andrew (so I figured he'd definately leave him alone and go after Van since Andrew usually isn't as good as Mark or Van).  Van was NE so I figured he went mass ancients, which he did. =) The only thing I was scared of was Mark's raiders, but after hearing "man, we just killed each other" (or something like that) from the two of them, I knew that was my que. In go 15 fully upgraded steam tanks from my secret mass production facility to the north of my base and it was over. =)<br><br>Hehe, now I think Mark and Van are going to kick me tomorrow. =)``xEpukyEZylkAvkNTDSZ``x1042624882``x(default)

I'm tempted to watch it instead of Smallville (blasphemous? ;), but I probably won't just because I'm not sure if I can go a WHOLE WEEK on some of those cliff hangers... wow.
