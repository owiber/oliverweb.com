Well POOO!!! I made one stupid mistake on my EE test and so I didn't get the 100 I thought I might've. Darn. =)  Well, I still got a 92 though, which was the 3rd highest in the class, so I'm still looking good.  Just a bit annoying. =)<br><br>Sam recently found a bruise on his right arm in virtually the exact same shape, location, and color as mine.

Apparently, people are just walking out of my EE class one by one (as I am typing this).  I think the class is half the size it was when it started 40 minutes ago... haha.

Sam, Andrew, and I (with some input from a few others) were talking about "deep" stuff the other day and I've decided to post about it a bit.  We arrived at the conclusion that pain existed in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:16 - "I will greatly increase your pains in childbearing...") and that pain/suffering is required in a relationship in order to grow (perhaps past a certain "line").  So pretty much, the main question is... what of pain/suffering in heaven?<br><br>According to Revelations (something, too lazy to look it up) and probably some other passages, there will no longer be any pain/suffering in heaven.  What of relationships then?  Do they become stagnant at that point and/or are these questions irrelevant since we can't comprehend heaven and our lives there?<br><br>I think we also talked about the why there is suffering and if it is a direct consequence of sin.  If so, why was there pain/suffering in Garden of Eden?  Because of Lucifer's sin?  I guess this also brings up the question... were Adam & Eve sinless before eating the fruit?  Or "merely" ignorant of their sins?<br><br>I'm not sure if I'm transcribing the ideas we talked about accurately or not... but hey, interesting nonetheless. =)</p>

So, I've gotten more used to the CMD+W/CMD+Q thing.  Here's my experience with the browsers:<br><br><b><a href=http://www.apple.com/safari/>Safari</a></b><blockquote><b>Good:</b> Nice integration with OS (ie. FTP links open in Finder, allowing easy download of folders, multiple files, etc.). <br><b>Bad:</b> Slow w/Gmail.</blockquote><br><b><a href=http://www.mozilla.org/products/camino/>Camino</a></b><blockquote><b>Good:</b> I like the way the tabs look. Haha.<br><b>Bad:</b> Nothing that really stands out... seems to load slightly slower than Safari.</blockquote><br><b><a href=http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/>Firefox</a></b><blockquote><b>Good:</b> Extensions rock. =) Just good 'ole Firefox.<br><b>Bad:</b> CMD+M is b0rk3d, it loads Mail instead of minimizing.</blockquote><br>For now, I've been using Camino... but I have all three in my dock and I change pretty frequently. =)<br><br>Some of OS X's "just works" stuff is kinda nice.  It's nice that they give you (for the most part) nice defaults that most people would want... however, it freakin' ticks me off when you can't change those defaults.  For example, when you plug in an external monitor, it automatically extends the desktop.  Okay, that's good. I like that.  However, what happens when I don't want to use the laptop LCD and I <i>just</i> want the PB to use the external monitor (with the laptop LCD open to use keyboard, touchpad)?... that's right, I can't do it (without some hacking, at least). So anyways, the best I can do for now is to mirror the display, but then I'm stuck at 1024x768 on the external monitor. Ugh.<br><br>Anyone know how to set your own profile in iChat? Yeah, I can't figure that one out yet.<br><br>My CPU temps hit 66.8C today while compiling KDE.  I flipped the PB on its side now (bottom of PB is perpendicular to table)... it cooled down to <65C... heh.<br><br>I had a big experience of inadequacy when it came to free "native" (as in, not using gFTP or something through X11) FTP clients for OS X.  So much so, that I started to look into writing my own.  I found that UT gave us Fetch for "free" (w/Bevoware) though, so I've played around with that and it seems like it would do the job.  Perhaps I'll write my own eventually anyways though, might be a nice little project to undertake. <br><br>Hmmm... oh, I LOVE <a href=http://synergy2.sourceforge.net>Synergy</a>.</p>

Alright... so the new HD is in and boot time and application launching is faster.  I still don't have that "snappy" feeling to the UI though. *shrug* Guess that's what happens when you have a power-hungry eye-candy-filled GUI.  I think the G5's have that "snappy" feeling... but I guess my 1.33 G4 is far from a dual G5. =)<br><br>I need to find a good graphical FTP client.  I tried one out, but I got frustrated with it cause it was screwing stuff up so I just went over to my A64 box and did what I needed there.  <a href=http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/fugu/>Fugu</a> is supposedly pretty good, but it only supports SFTP and not regular FTP... at least, that's what I can gather.<br><br>I did this when I first got the PB, but after the reinstall, I forgot and it took me freakin' forever to figure it out again.  In .vimrc, do this to fix delete key:<br><br>set t_kb=^?<br>fixdel<br><br>Where ^? is CTRL+V+DELETE.  I wish Apple set their vim defaults to something nice by default like virtually every Linux distro out there.<br><br>Oh yeah, if you format the iPod for Windows, you can use it on both Windows and OS X as both an iPod and removable hard drive.  Hmmmmm... what else... I haven't made too much use of Expose yet, so I won't say much about that yet.  The CMD+W, CMD+Q thing still bugs me a little, but I'm slowly getting more used to it.<br><br>I'd say my iPod experience has been more enjoyable than my PB experience thus far, but I definately need to get used to some of this stuff (*cough*FREAKING ONE BUTTON*cough*).  Thank goodness for <a href=http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/20854>SideTrack</a> or I would be really really not liking this.  Default touchpad speed and acceleration is also a bit slow, Sidetrack fixed that for me too.  Right now I have the tap on the touchpad being the right click, which is working okay for me.<br><br>I like how Safari opens FTP sites in Finder, but it doesn't seem to like Gmail very much and waddles through that much slower than Camino or FireFox.  I made Camino my default browser for now...<br><br>iChat is kinda fruity, so I made it even fruitier... that's the only way I can use.  The bubbles are kinda growing on me, I blame Brook for this one.  Terminal is the lame.  I very quickly replaced it with iTerm.  However, there is a "make delete send backspace" option in Terminal which is nice (this makes the above t_kb thing in .vimrc unnecessary).<br><br>Hmmmm, let's see... what else... oh yeah, Chad, you can turn on the ability to tab through alert buttons and stuff in System Preferences->Keyboard & Mouse->Keyboard Shortcuts->Turn on full keyboard access.  I don't know why this isn't on by default... oh well, at least it's there.<br><br>Alright, well I've got a ton more stuff to play with, so I'm off! =)</p>

I feel I must blog about my new PowerBook.

I'm not quite sure which one to go with as of yet.  I could get a 60GB, but I doubt I'm going to be needing all that space (especially with the 20GB from the iPod) so I'd rather save the money.  Also, 512MB RAM from Crucial is in order...<br><br>As for the "Mac experience"... I don't really have too much to say as of yet, mostly because I haven't done that much.  VJ is a freakin' Smallville Nazi and if you even try to blink when you're "supposed" to be watching Smallville, he will attempt to rip your intestines out through your ribs. Which reminds me, VJ VJ VJ VJ VJ VJ VJ VJ VJ VJ.<br><br>So, I'm going to withhold comments on my "Mac experience" until I finish upgrading the little thing, but I will note that I managed to freeze it within a few hours of use and had to hold the power button thingy down to restart it. Booooooo. That's nothing compared to Andrew locking up a G5 in the Apple store though.  What can I say?  We're masters.</p>
