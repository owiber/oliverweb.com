1082739530``xComment``xSean Ruyle``xa``x``xSounds like fun. I still havent broken down yet and taken graphics despite constant nagging from some friends of mine who loved it so much they took the grad school version the next semester. Remember my friend who made that chess game, he almost got into eurographics (like siggraph but in europe) with his real time tree simulation. He needed 4/5 positive reviews and he got 3.
