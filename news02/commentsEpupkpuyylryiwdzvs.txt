1040208140``xWC3``xAndrew``xa``x``xI would have went to sleep hours ago, but because some people leave the dorm in a mess (you all know who you are), I have spent the last 2 hours cleaning and that's just my stuff.  Too lazy to do Chad's stuff, so I'm off to bed.  Boy I didn't realize that LOTR and WC3 had so many things in common.  
1040252002``xLala``xOliver``xa``x``xI woke up at 4:40PM =)
1040260241``xGrrr``xOlivia``xa``x``xI, on the other hand, woke at up 12... and Oliver wouldn't wake up to his 4 phone calls (right after another, THANKS GUYS... you planned it...) AND he wouldn't wake up to pick up Oriana either... so I had to walk to Old Town... &gt; . &lt; GRRRRRRRR
1040506187``xBlarg``xWes``xa``x``xI....kind of didn't like lotr:tt that much.  It was okay, but I got bored by the Helm's Deep battle.  I really liked a lot of other stuff that I won't mention for the sake of those who've not seen it.  Hey, can I post on the main page, or has that privelage not been given back to me?
