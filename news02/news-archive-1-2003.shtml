Man, J.R.R. has to be one of the coolest dudes ever. I'm only half-way through LOTR, but I like it a lot. He just has a way of putting certain things into words (and by "words" I also mean the ones he made up =) to make it sound <i>cool</i>. I was talking to Mark and concluded that I would have very much liked to have hung out with Lewis and Tolkien (btw, what's with the initials? J.R.R, C.S.?) and smoked pipe with them in Oxford... even though that's probably what ended their lives.<br><br><i>Mithrander</i>... man, that's just so COOL. I don't know why I like it so much, but I think Tolkien's languages are really really spiffy. I, for one, would have no objection to this guy actually creating a real language for people to speak... it'd be the language of coolness. =)<br><blockquote><i>Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,<br>Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,<br>Nine for the Mortal Men doomed to die,<br>One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne<br>In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.<br>One Ring to Rule them all, One Ring to find them,<br>One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them<br>In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.</i></blockquote><br>Argh, so cool!<br><br>I've decided my son's name is going to be Mithrandir...<br><br>Okay, fine... maybe just his middle name. ;)</p>

HAHA... I just wanted to write this down so it is recorded and I can remember it in days to come. =)  "Andrew" just played a FFA Warcraft 3 game versus Mark and Van... the tricky thing was, it actually wasn't Andrew, it was me. =) AND, it was unknown that it was me and I even tried to play like Andrew in the beginning to throw Mark off. Hehe. =)<br><br>Also, I made a "truce" with Mark knowing he thought it was Andrew (so I figured he'd definately leave him alone and go after Van since Andrew usually isn't as good as Mark or Van).  Van was NE so I figured he went mass ancients, which he did. =) The only thing I was scared of was Mark's raiders, but after hearing "man, we just killed each other" (or something like that) from the two of them, I knew that was my que. In go 15 fully upgraded steam tanks from my secret mass production facility to the north of my base and it was over. =)<br><br>Hehe, now I think Mark and Van are going to kick me tomorrow. =)</p>
