I know Tolkien intended no allegorical connection between his story and the gospel of Jesus Christ -- but I've got to wonder.  What power holds man at bay?  What is so enticing to us that we become its slave -- even when we are fully aware of its destructive power?  To some it's drugs, alcohol and sexual addictions.  But what if it were our culture?  Could the \"one that rules them all\" -- or what I label sin -- be so subtle, and yet so pervasive that we don't even see it because we're immersed in it? hmmmm. bw
