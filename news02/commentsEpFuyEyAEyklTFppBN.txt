1034807901``xBirthday``xAndrew``xa``x``xThis is my birthday present to you:<Br><Br>Since you didn't like the ballons and cake that I got personally for you, this comment will have to do.  Happy Birthday Oliver, and best wishes.  Since you're 19, you need to be beat down.  Van and I will take you down, so beware.  Anyway enjoy being an old geezer.  <Br>
