<b>Just for the record... I'M NOT DRUNK... OR EVIL like I look in Oliver's picture's... And I miss Austin =(. People need to learn some damn "Southern Hospitality" in DC... which is odd cause Virginia was part of the "South" in the Civil War... damn traitors... they're just as snobby as the rest of the north... Cause you'd think that since DC is sorta half by Virginia... half by Maryland... then half the people would be nice... but NOOOO...

<b>Well, I have to hand it to you Oliver. This is a pretty nice page

you've got here. One thing though. I'm using Netscape 4.5 and there

are small (maybe 4 pixels) gaps in between your graphics. Are they

supposed to be there? Just curious about that. But, I guess there's

nothing more to say. Oh yeah, what do you need a script by Matt

Wright for?? You can make one yourself! ha ha ha, well, maybe not

yet, but when you do, I'll be the first to d/l it ;-) Well, I'll see ya later.

P.S. Is Charles serious about a church web page? If so, let me know,

I'd like to help ;-)</b><br>
