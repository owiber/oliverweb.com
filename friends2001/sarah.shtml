          		<div id=h2>Type of Music:</div>
          		<div id=d>EVERYTHING! Seriously. Pop (boy bands, Britney, the
                  whole deal), Christian, rock (even heavy metal sometimes),
                  oldies (I just found out I love Frank Sinatra!! Hehe),
                  Country, classical! I don't know what I would do without
                  music, it's probably my favorite thing on earth besides family

          		<div id=d>Oh. I guess those memories would go under this too.
                  Also sometimes with Afton. I can't really shrink it down to
                  one. Because no matter where we go, we find something
                  hilarious!! Even the Hong Kong Supermarket. Also with Brenda,
                  the Scottish Festival... when her Mom said something about the
                  guys legs in skirts and we spit out our food everywhere!! haha</div>

          		<div id=h2>Pet peeve(s):</div>
          		<div id=d>F word, hypocrites, Ms. Fanny. But she's gone.
                  Everybody should be lucky they're not going to Stony Point,

          		<div id=d>Well, um, let's see.&nbsp;I'm 5'5 or something and I
                  have straight blonde hair. Some people say it's gold. But
                  whatever. It's natural!! I like the color but that's about it.
                  Anyway. Um... I have brown eyes. I'm pretty shy &nbsp;to
                  people I don't know. People are like &quot;WOAH, you're so
                  quiet!&quot; And then if someone who knows me well is standing
                  close they start cracking up, and they're like &quot;Um...
                  Sarah's NOT quiet.&quot; It just takes me awhile. ;)&nbsp;</div>

                  <p><b>[Later]</b></p>
                  <div>
                    You know what really bugs me? Well it kind of has to do with
                    what Minix put in peeves, which I just read. When people
                    judge the big decisions people made in life when they don't
                    even know anything about WHY the person did it and they
                    don't even know the person. I don't like how people make a
                    decision about something (say.. um... abortion) and decide
                    that no matter what the circumstances could possibly be,
                    that person is BAD if they have abortion and they didn't
                    care about the baby and they don't feel sad about it and
                    they didn't think it was a big deal. NO! You don't know how
                    they feel!! For all you know it was the worst decision they
                    had to make in their life and it hurts them everyday to
                    think about it.
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    It also bugs me how people say &quot;Aw, it's just a little
                    toddler, he doesn't KNOW better.&quot; NO! You can teach
                    kids to be good when they're BABIES. When I was a baby, I
                    would start screaming every time my family sat down to
                    dinner (I couldn't eat regular food yet) because I wanted
                    attention. My parents would put me in my crib and shut the
                    door not paying any attention to me until I shut up.
                    Sometimes I tell people that and they give me this look like
                    it was cruel. Oh please. It's not like it hurt me. And my
                    parents say after a couple days I never did it again because
                    I found out it doesn't get me attention, all it does it get
                    me sent to a room all by myself. I think that children
                    aren't GOOD or BAD. The parents make them totally who they
                    are. Sure, everyone has their own traits. But when you are
                    raising a child, you can control so much of them. You can
                    teach them respect from the day that they are born.
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    ANOTHER thing (last thing, I promise) is how people decide
                    that people (well, teenagers) are bad just because they
                    smoke or drink. Not that I'm saying I support it or I do it.
                    But that doesn't make someone a BAD person. They may have
                    made a bad choice, I can go with that. But... it doesn't
                    make them a DRUGGIE or whatever. I admit I was the worse
                    person in the world for this a couple years ago (judging the
                    people, not smoking, Lol), but I'm glad I understand that
                    stuff better now. The people who you think are bad may
                    actually be some of the nicest, generous people you'll ever
                    meet. Ok. :) I think I should win the rant award. If there
                    is one. Someone try to beat me! No one is doing rants yet
                    this year. Well, not REAL rants. =D
