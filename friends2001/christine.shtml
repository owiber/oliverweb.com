                  &quot;God is Love&quot;)... So Im gonna go with the best

          		<div id=h2>Ten years?</div>
				<div id=d>ahh.... 25, 26, eh? I'm gonna assume that I'm going to
                  realize that i suck at theatre/speech, never should've majored
                  in it, and i'm gonna be lonely watching all my friends get
                  married, trying to convince myself i still dont care if anyone

          		<div id=h2>What do you want your future to be like?</div>
          		<div id=d>AH, ok, TOTALLY different question, what do I think,
                  and what I WANT... I want to land a modeling contract before
                  I'm out of High School, not go to college and move into the
                  acting business from modeling. After I make a name for myself,
                  I want to go to various<br>
                  places, doing motivational speaking on self esteem,
                  confidence, suicide, eating disorders, and many many other
                  issues teenagers face =) I want to change many people's live
                  and know that i've made a difference and made them happy. If I
                  cant get married, I (might) adopt a kid or something and I
                  want to watch her (or him) grow up, and I want give her
                  everything I couldn't have, and I want to see all of the
                  people I care about knowing/growing in God (as well as
                  myself),<br>
                  and I just want the world to be joyful. And I want all the
                  people who have struggled w/unresolved issues formost of their
                  lives to find peace (within God) and I want to see that they
                  find someone for them. I want to see that everyone knows how
                  much I care about them and<br>
                  know that no matter where they go they always have 2 places to
                  turn, me, or God. (God's better though, lol =) And I want....
                  Yeah i'm ranting now, sorry. But, yeah I have high hopes for
                  the future.</div>

				<div id=h2>3 Wishes:</div>
				<div id=d>1. salvation for everyone<br>
                  2. that everyone could understand how much they'er loved
                  beyond comprehension and they could find that love and share
                  it with someone till death do them part.(if they want it, i
                  guess, lol)<br>
                  3. I want to give the people in hell a second chacne<br>
                  (not possible, but... i feel bad for them) ... yeah... i think
                  that's what i'd wish for.</div>

           		<div id=h2>Misc.:</div>
          		<div id=d>oh wow i just looked on oliverweb and realized i was
                  supposed to type something here. something.</div>

          		<div id=h1>Rant(s)</div>
          		<div id=d>heh... brb....<br>
                  OK! I must beat Sarah! =) J/K but anyway, lookie here, humans
                  make mistakes? DUH! ALL of us sin, and on one level or
                  another, yes some are worse than others in the human eye, but
                  in God's eye, they're really all the same. EVERYONE deserves a
                  second chance<br>
                  in life, in my opinion. (i guess i have a lot of faith in
                  humankind, heh, but yeah...) People aren't born evil,
                  generally something happens to them to make them the way they
                  are. I think we should all darnded pray for those people like
                  heck, cuz they need major help. Help in which many times, only
                  the trusty old creator can give. They've (probably) been
                  through a ton of emotional junk (or maybe they haven't but
                  they'er having trouble handling it =( ) It definitely in no
                  way makes it any less right what they did... However, if
                  anyone of you tells me you've never sinned, you're lying
                  (sinning) in saying that! =) We've all made mistakes, taken a
                  wrong turn, and dont we wish we<br>
                  could fix what we did? Think about that. Then think about
                  someone's life going totally away (not necessarily killed, but
                  jailed maybe) because of a mistake, and there's nothing they
                  can do but if they could, (maybe) they'd take it all back and
                  do good. I pray that they get a chance to prove that they're
                  sorry. I've sure as heck done things i was sorry for.
                  Sometimes i wish i ahd a chance to tell the person I<br>
                  was sorry. I know thinking something bad, and murdering
                  someone is totally not on the same level, but I wish the best
                  for all people....... Something had to make someone turn that
                  way. Think about it. What happened to THEM? I dont know.... I
                  guess.... I was kinda frustrated when this one person was mean
                  to me. But then I thought what must have made him be liek that
                  and i just pray that they'll realize one day how much people
                  care about him. I have this other friend though, like omigosh,
                  she's been through so much!!!!!!! You never would've guessed
                  it, because she acts so kind, a great, and her faith in so
                  much with God. I admire her for that so much. That's the type
                  of<br>
                  person I hope those emotionally scarred people can become. For
                  being to have so much optimism when everything else seemed so
                  wrong. I DUNNO... BUT THATS JUST MY OPINION ON SOME STUFF!!!
                  (have i beat sarah yet? i dunno... but i'll just type a little
                  more before i have to go. I get internet back in a week! yay
                  =) Im at the library right now you see =) I could rant on
                  other stuff for a long time. hmmm... i just tried to figure
                  out if&nbsp; beat sarah and i cant tell....<br>
                  i wont know until my thing is posted up too. Sorry I'm being
                  so annoying Sarah, by the way. Being competitive or whatever.
                  I dont really mind if you win, Im just being a stupid dork...
                  Um... yeah... and i would also like to say that Josh Hartnett
                  is cute =) This actor<br>
                  dude. Who i dont even really know (obviously) or like but just
                  decided he was cute one day. That's just another opinion that
                  shouldn't be important though I guess. Because looks shoudlnt
                  be important. But our society can emphasize it a lot. Which
                  can give many girls low self esteem which is why I want to be
                  a model/actress who does the speaking so they can see it from
                  the point of view from someone who &quot;really knows&quot;
                  what shes talking about (not that other speakers<br>
                  dont). Did you know if you look in the mirror too much it's a
                  sign of low self esteem? (NOT NECESSARILY CONCEITED-NESS!) I
                  found that funny but it's true. Because you're always looking
                  to try and fix&nbsp; stuff on your face and always trying to
                  see what you can do next to fix about yourself. Im good
                  (better) about that now though. I can still nearly every
                  mirror in the mall in the stores i've been to tho (that would
                  take up a lot of words! YES!!!) But i wont. Im done with being
                  an my stupid self now. close, and sign off.&nbsp;
