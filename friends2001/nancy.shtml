                  on the floor?&quot; and he said balls though he claims he said
                  palms. I wasn't the only one who misheard. Anyhoo, it was a

                  with that boom...makes me want to run away and hide. Obnoxious
                  people. People who can't keep in touch. People who try to push
                  things. Adults who think they know what we're going through
                  and tell us it's nothing. C'mon we're a whole new generation
                  and everything is totally different now... People who don't
                  flush. Bathrooms that don't have that nice sanitary sheet.
                  Having to pee so much (yes i hate myself for that). Being
                  hungry and people not giving me food..hehe.. (yeah i know i
                  should provide my own). Getting cold and my stupid
                  vasoconstriction problem. Evil women. Radio playing those same
                  songs over and over and over like Janet Jackson,<br>
                  Survivor, Uncle something i don't care. And Mom being too

                  sugar-coated evil mass of men-hatred. You may THINK i care but
                  all i do is make up lame excuses that may seem quite valid but
                  then i back-stab<br>
                  and go back on my words and promises. I drown my friends with
                  my whinning and complaining about how I've been hurt and
                  crushed and betrayed. Hey<br>
