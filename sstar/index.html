                        School SIGNING STARS is an organization

                        and 12th grades at McNeil can become a
                        member. The basic requirement to become a
                        SIGNING STAR is a solid commitment to
                        remain chemical-free and be enrolled in
                        at least ASL I (American Sign Language I).&nbsp;

                        School and Live Oak Elementary School,
                        and sponsors Silent Dinners once per
                        month at local restaurants and Close-Captioned
