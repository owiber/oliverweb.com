<![CDATA[<p>Went running yesterday with Kathy and Olivia, and this time successfully did not lose Olivia, haha.  I also got really hungry yesterday for some reason and after eating dinner, I ate a turkey leg, chunks of cheese, an apple and other random stuff.  I think this running thing is making my metabolism go crazy... speaking of which, who wants to do <a href="http://www.hairymanfestival.org/5k.html">the Hairy Man 5k</a>? Haha...</p>

<p>*gack*  I just accidently swallowed my Starburst whole... oh... this is not a pleasant feeling... at all...</p>

<p>My work desk is covered with lots of boxes, wires going everywhere, LCD displays, and development boards.  Some coworkers that I make snack runs with made comments on how messy my desk was, so I cleaned it up a bit, haha.  It was becoming a problem when getting to my phone was difficult...</p>

<p>The new OliverWEB layout is getting there, but it still seems like it's missing a little bit... I'm not sure what it is yet.  I'll probably convert it to CSS/HTML soon and play around with it there a bit.  Going to use <a href="http://www.owiber.com">owiber.com</a> as my development location for now since I'm switching over to WordPress too.  Hip! Hip! HORAY!</p>

I know I've got to find<br />
Some kind of peace of mind"</i> - Jimmy Ruffin</p>

<p>Haha, all these lyrics read so much sadder than they sound (in the song)...</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Have a good semester/year, peeps. =)</p>

<p>Was around campus a few times the past week or two and it made me start to miss it a lot.  Poo.  Maybe it won't be so bad once everyone I know there has graduated, but I liked walking around campus with the swarms of people everywhere.  I think what I miss the most is random campus meets like lunches, late night snacks, and all that stuff.  It is nice to never have to worry about homework and tests now though and I have more money, haha... </p>

<p>I've got one idea for <a href="http://www.owiber.com">owiber.com</a>, but I'm not sure if it will conflict too much with OliverWEB... I may not be able to keep both updated concurrently... so we'll see.</p>

<p>So I've been considering running around Town Lake without a shirt so that I don't get an absurd farmer's tan... but right now, I currently have a very visible heart on my chest which is making me hesitate a bit... lol.</p>

<p>Edit: Forgot lyrics. =)</p>

I tried to make an owiber Blogger account, but apparently I <a href="http://owiber.blogspot.com/">already had one</a>, so I just made a post instead.

<p>Now I'm not sure what to do with owiber.com.  I could just make it point to OliverWEB as well, but I was thinking something else would be more fun... <i>but what?</i> =)</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I don't know if it's just the weather, the having to go back to work after a great vacation, the missing school-feeling or what, but I felt rather gloomy today.  When I run, I set landmarks for myself that I force myself to hit.  "Just get to the next bridge" or something more important like "just make it to land, so you don't drown."  I guess I felt like that today... "just get through the meeting" or "just finish up _______ for _______ and before you know it, you'll get to go home."</p>

<p>I really feel like running... in the rain, unfortunately, the rain's probably over now, eh?  Oh well, at least the sun's heat is somewhat deflected by the clouds... <i>but not the UV rays, kids!</i></p>

<![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, we went to church and then did a bunch of nothing to recooperate from the Busch Gardens and beach trips the prior two days.  Had nice mid-day naps. Yaaaay!  Then we watched The New World, which was a horrible waste of time and Flightplan, which was less so.</p>

<p>I don't even really know if I have any pictures or videos from yesterday worth mentioning... I might scrounge up the flash cards and see later though.  Speaking of which, I uploaded <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber/sets/72157594253941893/">pictures from Busch Gardens</a> yesterday.</p>

<p>Anyways, back in Austin now and I am ready to take a long nap.  Thanks to Andrew, Jen, and all the other Floridians that hung out with us while we were there, had a great time!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Today we went to some beach four hours away and woke up really early to do so.  Was quite a bit of fun, but I think all of us (except for Andrew) got burnt.  I did, however, put a small amount of sunscreen on myself (or rather, other people put it on me) to make a heart on my chest, a smiley on my right arm and "MOM" on my left arm.  The heart didn't turn out so well, I think, but Van <i>might</i> have a decent picture.</p>

<p>I'm going to be uploading pics to my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/owiber">flickr</a> as I sleep, I'll title them later... heh... Edit: Ok, never mind, I titled them already. =)  And here's a pic just for our favorite Brit:</p>

<p>We finished the night off watching True Lies at Jen's again... wheeeee!</p>

<p>And, this song is a throat killer:</p>

<p><i>"If I should stay,<br />
I would only be in your way.<br />
So I'll go <br />
But I know <br />
I'll think of you every step of the way.</p>

<p>We also rode ultra-exciting rides like the following log ride (feel free to stop watching after a minute or so... it gets boring after that, haha):</p>

<p>Haha... actually, it was pretty fun (and the coasters were more lively than the above =)... Kathy even went on some! ...and got really nasty wrinkled feet from getting socks/shoes soaked... ewww... but she wouldn't let me take a picture of them.</p>

<p>Afterwards, we went back to Jen's place and watched Four Brothers... better than I expected it to be, actually, haha.</p>]]>

<br />I like leaving messages for my roomies.  Sometimes they're nice, sometime's they're not. =)</p>

<p>On an entirely unrelated note, I tried the "shortcut swim" again, but this time giving Kathy my shoes before doing so and it went oh so much better, haha...</p>

<![CDATA[<p>You guys need to blog more, I can't keep the blog count up for everyone here.  What am I supposed to do when I'm waiting for a kernel to finish compiling, huh?</p>

<p>I was thinking of cool things to do in Florida and somehow thought it would be funny to bring a bag full of LEGOs to the beach, but decided that was probably a bad idea (I'm sure you can come up with quite a few reasons why).  Then, I thought it'd be cool to bring that bag on the airplane to build something cool on the flight, but realized I would probably drive everyone around me insane with all the LEGO shuffling, haha.</p>

<p>So I think I like the 50mm on the 5D a lot better than the 85mm.  I think the 85mm still seems a bit too "tight" for me for everything except solo portrait shots (which it does insanely well with... oh the bokeh...).  I bought a 50mm f/1.4 which should hopefully arrive before the Florida trip.  Highly considering selling the 85L, if my run with the 50mm f/1.4 goes well.  I know it won't be nearly as sharp... but since I already have the 85 f/1.8 (which is nearly just as sharp as the 85 f/1.2, just can't stop down as low and doesn't have <i>as</i> nice bokeh), I'm not sure if I use the 85L enough to justify keeping it...</p>

<p>Although, I just realized that since I'm taking tomorrow off, I could have done it then.  Oh well, more time to <i>relaaaaax</i>. =)</p>

<p>Uh oh, meeting time...</p>
