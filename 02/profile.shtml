underneath the sun,<br>
bluest eyes that spark with lightning,<br>
boy with shoes undone.<br>
He is young, so full of hope,<br>
reveling in tiny dreams,<br>
filling up, his arms with flowers,<br>
right for giving any queen.
<br><br>
Running to her beaming bright,<br>
while cradling his prize.<br>
A flickering of yellow light,<br>
within his mother's eyes.<br>
She holds them to her heart,<br>
keeping them where they'll be safe,<br>
clasped within her very marrow,<br>
dandelions in a vase.<br>
<br>
She sees love, where anyone else would see weeds.<br>
all hope is found.<br>
Here is everything he needs.<br>
<br>
Fathomless your endless mercy,<br>
weight I could not lift.<br>
Where do I fit in this puzzle,<br>
what good are these gifts?<br>
Not a martyr, or a saint,<br>
scarcely can I struggle through.<br>
All that I have ever wanted,<br>
was to give my best to you.<br>
<br>
Lord, search my heart,<br>
create in me something clean.<br>
Dandelions<br>
you see flowers in these weeds.<br>
<br>
Gently lifting hands to heaven,<br>
softened by the sweetest hush,<br>
a Father sings over his children,<br>
loving them so very much.<br>
More than words could warrant,<br>
deeper than the darkest blue,<br>
more than sacrifice could merit,<br>
Lord, I give my heart to you.
