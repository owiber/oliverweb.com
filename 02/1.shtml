Well, there is going to be stuff here eventually... but I'll get to it later.

I know this is the 4th OliverWEB layout (despite the v3 in the corner). "v4" just
didn't look as cool, so my explanation is as follows: I am a computer scientist.
Computer scientists work with arrays a lot. In most programming languages, arrays
start at 0 and move up from there. My first OliverWEB layout is 0, second 1, etc.
There you go. Have a nice day. =)
