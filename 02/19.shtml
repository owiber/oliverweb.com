Well, in one of my artistic moods a day or two ago, I made what you can see to the left for Nancy (cause I asked her what I should make and she predictably said "frogs" =). It's 4:30AM right now and I had planned on going to bed a few hours earlier, but I was in the bathroom looking at my webdesign book thingy and got a spark of inspiration.<br>So now, I have some new friends... you can see them <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/gallery/friends.gif>here</a>! I'll think of names later. =)
