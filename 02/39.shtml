Well, I'm finally changing this thing.  This is a MK:DD bug. Look at Player 1 & Player 4.  Sam somehow fell off, and was put back on the wrong portion of the track.  Too bad I still caught up to him and beat him.  He did end up having to do another lap though and it seemed to fix itself as we passed the finish line...
