Mark and I just played against two insane computer players on Ice Crown and kicked their butts! =) This was after a game with two insanes where they demolished Mark, but with our combined micro-managing of Archmage and Sorceresses, we managed to keep them back for almost an hour. Insanity. Pure insanity.<br>
Oh, and poor Brook has a computer that hates him a lot.
