Yeah, so... this happened a few days ago, but I'm going to put this up now. Was playing the beta of C&C:Generals (comes out Feb.13!!! =) with Van and this spontaneously happened. At least I already killed one guy and all that was needed was for Van and I to clean up the other guy... although I did it half-paying attention. Those things made it very hard to do stuff! =)
