Yeah... so I just installed Red Hat 8.0 and it doesn't seem to like my GeForce4. =( X won't start which is no good cause I was looking forward to seeing the eye candy. So I reboot to go back to Windows and it seems as if Red Hat messed up that too. =/ Now my Win2k blue screens on start-up. *sigh*<br>
I just hope my win partition is okay...
