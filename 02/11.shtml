So my Mozilla's been acting weird on me lately which has resulted in my inevitable trial of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/phoenix/">Phoenix</a> (currently at 0.3). It's actually pretty spiffy and I like how it is... not bloated at all and it runs quite smoothly. I even made it my default browser for now... =)<br><br>Ahh... gotta love open source. =)
