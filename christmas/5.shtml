<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The song "Thriller" started playing all
around!</font>

<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"So make up your mind and don't be like
the three Stooges."</font>

Micheal Jackson like] Minix was back in bed.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">And this is what he said...</font>
