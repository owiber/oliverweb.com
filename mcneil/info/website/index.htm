                  school year , shortly before I graduated. Since I am now
                  unable to keep it up, I have written this page in order for
                  future webmasters to... eh... carry on the torch I guess.
                  Hopefully, you will be able to get an idea of what I've done
                  and improve on it... and not get totally confused by all of my
                  work and ending up starting all over again. =)</font><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">As
                  you may or may not know, the website before this
                  reconstruction wasn't too great. It wasn't uniformed and was a
                  bit too simple. What I tried to achieve was uniformity, yet
                  uniqueness across all of McNeil's pages. A majority of the
                  pages use the layout used on this page, but a few (for now, as
                  I wasn't able to do many before I graduated) use variations of
                  this, such as SHS, Mu Alpha Theta, etc. Generally, the layout
                  is the same, except for some different colors here and there
                  with a different top-right image. This allows for the
                  professionalism of uniformity, yet allows for some creativity,
                  so I urge all of you to try to keep that up. =)</font><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In
                  order for that to be kept up, I created this page shortly
                  after I graduated to help all you future webmasters. Now, I'm
                  assuming you at least have a bit of web-authoring knowledge,
                  as the things I will be talking about aren't going to be
                  exactly childs-play. ;) If you don't know what I'm talking

                  <b>
                  SSI</b> - If you don't know what SSI is, then you can skip this.
                  SSI (server side includes) was not used for the simple reasons
                  of: I wasn't sure if it was server-supported (although it
                  probably is), and it might confuse future webmasters who
                  didn't know what it was... as well as teachers/administrators
                  who try to figure out what I did. I know if I used SSI it
                  would make things much easier to change globally, but...
                  sorry... I decided it would be a bad idea.</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Tables</b> - The layout, basically,
                  was created (HTML-wise) using tables... a lot of them. If you
                  don't understand tables and cannot work with them well, then
                  please do not try to make a new layout. Please make sure you
                  at least look at my coding, or understand how I did it before
                  you try to do it yourself... if you don't know how to work
                  with tables, you may end up messing something up and getting
                  very frustrated.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Layers/CSS</b> - Layers were not
                  used due to browser compatibility. As least when I was at
                  McNeil, a majority of the school was still using Netscape with
                  a few using IE, which makes it very hard to use &quot;advanced
                  technology&quot; such as CSS/layers and still have it render
                  fine on both platforms. Very simple style sheets were used,
                  just to make links be non-underlined:</font></p>
          

                      <pre>
                        &lt;style&gt;&lt;!--
                        A:link {text-decoration: none}
                        A:visited {text-decoration: none}
                        A:active {text-decoration: none}
                        A:hover {text-decoration: underline}
                        --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;</pre>

          
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>WYSIWYG</b> - Generally, I don't
                  like WYSIWYG editors and prefer to do things
                  &quot;manually.&quot; But since many of the
                  teachers/administrators use WYSIWYG editors, I used Frontpage
                  2000 to create a majority of the pages, to ensure that it was
                  they would be able to edit some things on some pages alright.
                  So as a result, even though you might like to do things
                  &quot;manually,&quot; try to at least feed your code through a
                  WYSIWYG editor and make sure it comes out alright. This also
                  influenced my non-SSI decision.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Directory

                  tried to make a majority of the links relative instead of

                  www.roundrockisd.org/mcneil/blablabla). For those of you who
                  may not don't know:</font>
                  <ul>

                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Images</b> - When
                  putting an image on a page, try to put a small black border around
                  it like so:</font>
   
                  <pre>
                  &lt;img src=&quot;imageurl.jpg&quot; border=1&gt;</pre>
   
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">See the directory structure
                  image as an example. The border makes the image/page look
                  cleaner and more professional. There are of course, some
                  images that just don't benefit from the border (such as
                  non-rectangular/square images that have a transparent
                  background, etc.)... just use your best judgment. Photos
                  really benefit from the border, however.</font></p>
   
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Misc. </b> - Please, please,
                  please... use ONLY the font Arial... unless if you are doing a
                  club page, or something else like that. Do not leave the font
                  as the default Times New Roman, or something ugly like that.
                  =) Also, try not to put too many colors and/or different font
                  variations into one page. Try to keep it simple, professional,
                  etc.</font>

                  files/locations. I often find the &quot;Replace&quot; feature
                  nice in those circumstances. =)</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For the default layout, all the
                  the image files needed are at root (we'll call root <a href="http://www.roundrockisd.org/mcneil">www.roundrockisd.org/mcneil/</a>
                  since we'll never be touching <a href="http://www.roundrockisd.org">www.roundrockisd.org</a>).
                  If you're making a new layout for one page, put all the files
                  it needs into its own folder, don't dump everything into
                  root... that makes it cluttered, messy and confusing.
                  Basically the only thing I have organized is my website's
                  directory structure... everything else, my room, desk, bed,
                  shelves... is all a mess. =) Please try to keep it that way,
                  it helps people in the future who are trying to figure out
                  what you did.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Basically, what you will need
                  to do is edit the file found in <a href="mcneil.zip">mcneil.zip</a>
                  (see next section for more details), then crop it up into many
                  different pieces to throw into the tabled layout. The easiest
                  thing to do, I think, would be to feed the template into a
                  WYSIWYG editor, then replace images with the new images you've
                  created. Keeping the same dimensions between your new cropped
                  up images and the images used on this/the template page would
                  be nice... although it can be time-consuming sometimes. Here's
                  an illustration of how many images are needed for the page:</font></p>
