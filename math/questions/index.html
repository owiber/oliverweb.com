              *cough* - although the lowly (yet very awesome *cough*) webmaster,
              Oliver did write a few of them] makes up questions for you to
              answer for Mu Alpha Theta points. Or you can just do them for fun.
              Woohoo. I bet all of you want to do that, don't you?! Victoria
              could make up questions, but then we'd have another bunch of
              math-relay questions and we don't want those. Plus, who wants a
              Victoria's Korner? That just doesn't make sense, and Victoria's Vicinity
              just doesn't sound as cool as &quot;Kenny's Korner.&quot; Sorry
              Victoria. ;) Hehe, just kidding. Anyways...

              point for it. Who said math people don't have a sense of humor?

								I'm Bobo, your host. I'm going to put complete nonsense in here just to fill up space because I am so bored. I have no clue what to talk about. Talk about math? MATH?? Why would I want to talk about that for? Math stinks. Oh, this is a math honor society? Doh, why didn't someone tell me that before I ran for an officer? I'm just kidding, btw. And my name is really Oliver, not Bobo.
