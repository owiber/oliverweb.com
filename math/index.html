							<p><b>Puzzles:</b></p>
							<p><center><h2>Kenny's Korner (aka the puzzles page) now has it's own page! <a href=./questions/>Go to it</a> now!</h2></center></p>
							<!--p>Kenny's Korner! This is where Kenny makes up questions for you to answer for Mu Alpha Theta points. Or you can
							just do them for fun. Woohoo. I bet all of you want to do that, don't you?! Victoria could make up questions, but then
							we'd have another bunch of math-relay questions and we don't want those. Sorry Victoria. ;) Hehe, just kidding. Anyways, <b><i>email your answers <a href=mailto:mathanswer@oliverweb.com>here</a>.</i></b>(Questions are all worth <b>one</b> point each - <b>max three</b> points)</p>
							<p><b>Q1:</b> What is: (log<sub>2</sub>4)(log<sub>4</sub>8)(log<sub>8</sub>16)(log<sub>16</sub>32)(log<sub>32</sub>64)</p>
							<p><b>Q2:</b> Prove that <font face="Times New Roman" size=3><i>e</i><sup><font face=symbol size=3>p</font><i>i</i></sup></font>=-1</p>
							<p><b>Dedications to Chad:</b><br>The following questions were inspired by Chad W. (Go Chad Go!) Heh... have fun.<br><br>
							<b>Q3:</b> "Prove" that 2=1 (It's not... obviously... but... try it. Here, we'll give you the first step: a=b)</p>
							<p><b>Q4:</b> What is .99999999... (repeating) in "fraction form?" Prove your answer.</p>
							<p><b>*:</b> Prove that x=x using highly advanced calculus methods dating back to Pythagorean times such that the answer is so complicated to comprehend
							that a point is mandatory to receive a reward for your ignorance and time. [Note: This is a joke... you can try it, but don't expect a point for it. Who said math people don't have a sense of humor? Haven't you heard one of Mr.Fulkerson's jokes?! =)]-->

								I'm Bobo, your host. I'm going to put complete nonsense in here just to fill up space because I am so bored. I have no clue what to talk about. Talk about math? MATH?? Why would I want to talk about that for? Math stinks. Oh, this is a math honor society? Doh, why didn't someone tell me that before I ran for an officer? I'm just kidding, btw. And my name is really Oliver, not Bobo.
