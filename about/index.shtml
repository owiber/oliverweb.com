<center><h2><font color="blue">About OliverWEB</font></h2><p></center>
OliverWEB was created by me, Oliver Wong! It was founded on October 15, 1999 
(one day before my 16th birthday! =) and was opened on the 17th. All graphics used for the
layout were created by me using <a href=http://www.jasc.com>Paint Shop Pro</a> (looking forward to
getting <a href=http://www.adobe.com>Adobe Photoshop</a> ;). The font used for the layout is 
NightSky, which I downloaded from <a href=http://www.acidcool.com>AcidFonts</a> (very good font site =).<p>
Inspiration to create OliverWEB was first sparked during the Summer of 1999, when 
I was really really bored =). I created <a href=http://www.oliverweb.com/boredom2/index.html>Boredom2</a>
during that summer and decided that I should get my own domain name.
At first, I was going to get OliverWong.net (OliverWong.com was already taken by some Oliver Wong 
in Britain!) or OliverNET.com, but I decided on OliverWEB.com (thanks to 
<a href=mailto:wakko7blue@yahoo.com>Claire</a> for that name! =).<p>
OliverWEB's main audience is my close friends because there are/will be tons of inside jokes that only
they will get, but other people (not total strangers though =) are welcome to take a look. =) Speaking 
of inside jokes, I guess I'll explain the "...and ANON is funny" part of the OliverWEB 
<a href=http://www.oliverweb.com>intro</a>. Okay, it 
came about when <a href=mailto:cutiepatootie124@hotmail.com>Grace</a> and 
<a href=mailto:youshouldknowthisbynow@oliverweb.com>I</a> were looking at 
<a href=http://www.quoteland.com target="new">this one</a> quote page when the following chat occured:<p>
<blockquote><font size=2>
<b><font color=blue>PiFactor5:</font></b> hehe, "On the other hand, the early worm gets 
eaten." -Anon
<br><b><font color=red>AngeLuve16:</font></b> haha
<br><b><font color=blue>PiFactor5:</font></b> hah, Anon is funny =)
<br><b><font color=red>AngeLuve16:</font></b> um...
<br><b><font color=blue>PiFactor5:</font></b> um?
<br><b><font color=red>AngeLuve16:</font></b> it means, "Anonymus" I think...
<br><b><font color=blue>PiFactor5:</font></b> lol
<br><b><font color=blue>PiFactor5:</font></b> oops
<br><b><font color=red>AngeLuve16:</font></b> HAHAHA
<br><b><font color=red>AngeLuve16:</font></b> you're stupid
<br><b><font color=blue>PiFactor5:</font></b> I'm a smart one
<br><b><font color=red>AngeLuve16:</font></b> =)
<br><b><font color=blue>PiFactor5:</font></b> ok, I really feel dumb now...
<br><b><font color=blue>PiFactor5:</font></b> dang! that was stupid...
<br><b><font color=red>AngeLuve16:</font></b> Hahaha
<br><b><font color=red>AngeLuve16:</font></b> that wasn't stupid
<br><b><font color=red>AngeLuve16:</font></b> it was RETARDED
<br><b><font color=blue>PiFactor5:</font></b> wah, leave me alone...
<br><b><font color=red>AngeLuve16:</font></b> STUPID STUPID STUPID
<p></blockquote></font>
So... that's where "Anon is funny" came from =) Makes me laugh everytime... along with 
"It's like talking to dung," but I didn't say that one. =)<p>
Hmmmm... anything else I need/want to say about OliverWEB? I dunno... maybe I'll add some later. =)
<p>Oh yeah, and the little pi symbol at the bottom right of this page is my trademark... I put it on
almost every webpage I make. =) Ack, there's some hair in my keyboard... I gotta clean it...<p>
